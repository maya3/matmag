Every parent with two kids face this familiar situation when a first-born faced with a new arrival of his/ her brother or sister expresses anger and resentment. Our normal reaction to it is to criticise and tell them to behave. Though we can achieve that, to make them to behave in the way we want, but we amplify angriness and push their negative feelings deep, only for them to pop up later. We need always explicitly say we will always love them no matter what. 

Dr Laura Markham published the book [Calm Parents, Happy Siblings: How to Stop the Fighting and Raise Friends for Life] to teach the parents how to deal with siblings’ rivalry based on research. She says that sibling rivalry is universal, it is in our instincts to protect ourselves to survive – in case of siblings, it is a competition for parents’ attention. Many factors play roles to shape kids’ relationships with each other. Older, more active children can create more conflicts. Kids who are closer in age, Dr Markham, says fight more as they have similar needs, but at the same time play more with each other and can develop deeper bond. 

Dr Markham says that it is difficult to succeed by 100% as children also differ by character, temper, but as parents we can help to improve the relationships between them. The key to her approach is to try to adjust our own behaviour and reactions. Practice to be calm is important aspect, try a deep breathing in a situation, where in the past you just yell. **Her approach is to stay connected to your children**, so they can actually listen to the parent. Kids fight less where parents are less punitive and avoid being dragged in the conflict. Allowing kids to sort out their own conflicts without parental intervention teaches them the quite important life skill. Instead of marching in in the middle of the row and impose your own solution, it is beneficial to involve kids. We stay calm, listen to both side and invite them to make their own decision. 

As parents, we can make a difference to our children’s relationships at any age, not just when they are little. Here are some extracts from Dr Markham’s book:

### Dealing with aggression ###
Quite often the preferred parental tool of choice when facing the aggression from one of the kids is punishment. This, however, produces the opposite effect, - resentment in the punished child. Normally, the aggression comes from the fear that the child is no longer loved and the need of attention. To deal with the instigator try to stay kind and calm, look at the child’s eye and say something like “Your sister (brother) was hurt and scared. You must be so upset to kick her (him)… Something is making you feel that way”. Try to show your understanding of his/ her feelings by saying “it’s Ok to be angry, but it’s never Ok to kick another person. What could you do instead?” In that scenario the child-agressor may come up with other peaceful ways of resolving the conflict.
Don’t force the apology afterwards: the victor feels like they have won, and the one apologising gets mad all over again. Instead, when emotions are calmer, say, “ I wonder what you could do to make things better?”

### Don’t make them share ###
Dr Markham’s solution to sharing goes against our normal behaviour in these circumstances. When two children want a toy and you select one to have it, even temporarily and for a good reason, both children see you as choosing one sibling over the other. Instead use a system of self-regulated turns instead: that means the child is free to use the toy for as long as she wants, then she gives it up to the other child when she’s ready. But what about the poor sibling who has to wait for his turn? Reassure him you’ll help him wait and divert his attentions to something else. He is developing impulse control and the ability to delay gratification. Turns should always start again next morning.

### Reduce completion ###
When siblings close in age and both male this problem could be more pronounced. Making each child feel secure and loved without limits is the key to cutting down on siblings’ competitiveness. In practice, it means more hugs and smiles and more time together. “Special time” with each child is important. Older siblings, particularly, need one-to-one time with their parents to feel that special role of being an older child, so that the younger child looks up to them. 

### Never compare ###
Never compare children, otherwise they are more likely to compete. Normally, these comparisons start inside your head. Instead of thinking, “Helen is not the pupil that Claire is”, just try to think that Helen does not seem to like school very much. Also, avoid labelling children as “artists”, “athletes” etc. It will limit their opportunities to try out new experiences and create more sibling rivalry.

### Bonding ###
Celebrating your family and coming up with routines and traditions will foster bonding. To have a dinner at a table and share the day’s up and downs is important, not only for siblings relationship, but for the whole family. If one child gets hurt, it will be a good practice for everyone in the family tend to them – hold back a moment to see if the siblings step in to help. Rough and tumble play is also important: when kids play-fight they learn to manage aggression which makes them less likely to lash out when they are angry. Evolve new traditions; you might let the children camp in the garden at the end of the summer, for example. Children will find these siblings traditions very special and they will create memories together that will positively impact their entire year.
