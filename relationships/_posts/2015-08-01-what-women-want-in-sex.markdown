In a book Come as You Are by US academic, Emily Nagoski is going on a quest to answer my questions and dispel myths about female sexuality based on the latest research. She shows how everyone has their own unique sexuality, much like a fingerprint. Once women understand how their particular sexual response mechanisms work, they can improve their sex lives. 

This is what **her research reveals**:

### Female sexual desire takes work ###
Nagoski says that only about 15 per cent of women want sex regularly and out of the blue. Nearly a third of women instead experience responsive desire, which means they begin to want sex only after sexy things are already happening such as their partner kissing or touching them. This doesn’t mean they have low desire, stresses Nagoski. Their bodies just need a more compelling reason to have sex than “spontaneous desire”.

### Sex drive does not exist ###
The body’s interest in sex is driven by attractive external stimulus. If you approach your own or partner’s sexuality with curiosity, with a playful attitude, you will enjoy sex more.

### For women: emotional sex is better sex ###
Sex in a particular context means more for women. The sexual experience is shaped by the present moment – who you are with, where you are, whether the situation is novel, familiar, risky or safe. How the brain perceives the situation is also greatly affecting the circumstances surrounding sex: if she is feeling relaxed or stressed, loving or not. Women are more emotional, the context of their sexual relationship can affect their sexual pleasure. Nagoski says that for women to improve their sexual experiences they need to learn about the good and bad triggers from the past experiences.

### What influence on female arousal ###

According to Nagoski, there are **four influences that increase female desire**:

- Love/ emotional – feeling of love, being “special” from a partner;
- Explicit/ erotic – watching a sexy movie or noticing your own or your partner’s arousal;
- Visual – seeing an attractive, well-dressed potential partner;
- Implicit/ romantic – intimate behaviours (dancing closely, sharing a bath, whispering)
A blend of erotic and romantic cues increases desire in women.

### Female orgasm ###
Nagoski believes that most problems with orgasm are derived from too many worries and too much stress and anxiety, including about the orgasm itself. The central approach is paying attention to pleasure and letting go of the goal (to reach orgasm).

### Sex in midlife ###
Sex is an attachment behaviour, reinforcing a bond between adults. When attachment is at its most secure and stable, sexual arousability can take a back seat. However, even in a long-term relationship people can increase their craving and pleasure with sex. Couples aged 45 or older, who reported good sex lives, emphasised the important of maintaining a close, connected, and trusting friendship; and making sex a priority in their lives. 

Sometimes, having a bit of distance in a relationship is a good thing, like giving space to each other to pursue their own interests or meeting friends. In a long-term relationship, to rekindle passion you have to take on a pro-active role

### Sexual response mechanism ###
Nagoski described “the sexual response mechanism in your brain”: like in a car a body has the accelerator and the brakes. She describes them thus: the Sexual Excitation System (SES) is the accelerator, and responds to sexy things such as an attractive person or the thrill of a new relationship.

The Sexual Inhibition System (SIS) is the brake and it notices all the reasons not to be turned on such as relationship conflict, sleep deprivation, money or family worries or feeling obliged to have sex. The process of becoming aroused is the process of both turning on all the “ons”, ie accelerators, and turning off all the “offs”, ie, the brakes. It’s possible to learn how to increase sexually relevant things in your life so that the accelerator becomes more dominant than the brake. Women should spend time working out what the problem is, then work out how to create change.

Some accelerators are foreplay (touching each other and smelling each other’s scent), fantasies (a woman’s imagination is one of her most powerful sexual tools), erotica (some women like novels, some porn) and vibrators (particularly good if you struggle with orgasm).

Brakes can include stress (physical activity, sleep or massage can help to combat it), worries about being interrupted (if kids’ may walk in, get a door lock), being too tired (try to prioritise sex in favour of the house being “perfect”), being self-conscious about one’s body (focus on pleasure instead). Once the problem has been identified, try to make  a change.
