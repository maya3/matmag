How honest should you be with your partner? Will some white lies protect your relationship, or won’t they? This and other important questions about relationship are being answered by the psychotherapist Jean-Claude Chalmet who practices [family therapy](http://Wherediditallgowrong.com) consultations. The conversation with him was taken from the original article from [The Times](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/life/article4203977.ece) published on 13 September 2014.

A survey published recently found that **one in four women and one in five men admit to looking at their partner’s messages and Facebook accounts**. The study of 13,132 people, by security firm Avast, found that few suspected infidelity – most investigated out of curiosity. About 12 per cent thought their partners might be lying to them about something. It can be easier to spy than to confront. It’s so common, it doesn’t even seem wrong. When choosing a car, we’ll discuss every option, but with a relationship, we’re often too afraid to state our preferences. We fear that showing who we are will lead to loneliness, abandonment and rejection.

### Is it bad to check your partner’s phone? ###

Rather than become hyper-vigilant, in a healthy relationship you’d mention it: “I notice so-and-so always comments on your posts”. The implicit understanding is that this makes you uncomfortable: your partner will realise he needs to reassure you. This is honest, effective communication. **If you do find yourself sneakily reading his messages, the issue is much about your dishonesty with yourself, as with him**. Why check his phone? Why not just ask? Because you suspect he won’t tell you the truth. Meaning, you already know you can’t’ trust him. Ferreting through a bad is symptomatic of a lack of trust: the dishonesty marbles the relationship, it’s not just a single streak. 

If your partner is secretive about calls, rather than waking at 2am to scroll through his phone, why not say, “Can I ask why you won’t answer a call in front of me? It makes me feel insecure”. Being honest entails facing your vulnerabilities and core fears – acknowledging that you might have made a mistake in trusting someone. The short-term pain of accepting the truth is preferable to the long-term pain of believing an illusion.

### How honest should I be about my sexual history? ###

What happened before you met is private. If you feel obliged to share, **only be as honest as your partner can take**. If you feel you’ll strengthen your intimacy by not having to hide certain facts, and that your bond is strong enough to withstand a few X-rated jolts, by all means. This is a personal decision, closely linked to common sense. But avoid comparisons, or boasts of a previous lover’s prowess. The crux is, will this anecdote benefit your relationship and increase trust? If not, leave it out.

### How much should I edit my relationship history? ###

When you bleat every last excruciating detail – the dream is to be loved unconditionally – consider your motives. Is it that only if this person accepts you, can you accept yourself? **If you have fully accepted who you are, you don’t need external validation**. Sometimes being economical with the truth is not lying. After a painful break-up, you have embarked on an uncharacteristic bender, sleeping with 30 people. Does your beloved need to know this? I think not.

Employ sensitivity, and consideration. It’s also very important that we each have a secret garden. To merge is to lose your individuality. Instead of standing nose to notes, stand back to back, holding hands, and retain your individual views of the work.

That makes a relationship strong. With nothing left to discover, a relationship stagnates.

### How much do I need to share about my financial affairs? ###

If you both contribute to a pot of joint expenses, full financial disclosure beyond that doesn’t necessarily suggest a strong relationship. If you’re content to share the detail of every asset, marvellous, but one shouldn’t feel obliged. However, if you are spending significant sums on the sly – that’s different. You’re persisting in a habit, damaging to the relationship, behind your partner’s back. If you have an emotional problem, siphoned into shopping addiction, why can’t you talk to your partner? Chances are, it’s because they’ll voice what you already know: it’s not acceptable.

It’s tempting to reduce the quilt attached to lying, by normalising it: “Oh, everybody does it”. The fact is, if you feel unable to be honest, that’s a problem in a relationship. Then the question is, how good is your communication, how loving is your relationship? If you wanted support, and were confident of getting it, you’d talk about any financial issues.

### I overstate my success to sound more fabulous. Is that so bad? ###

It’s natural to want to present yourself favourable. However, not only will too much bragging eventually rebound – no one likes to be deceived – people instinctively shy away from someone who oversells themselves; who too obviously craves admiration and praise. 
We want to go out with someone stable and secure, who cares about themselves, because if you love yourself, you have the capacity to love. **A needy, insecure, demanding person is not attractive** – though it might enchant someone who enjoys exerting control.

### I pretend to work late to avoid domestic drudgery ###

Your partner skips the kids’ bath time, claiming a three-hour meeting. It becomes apparent, from his beery hello kiss, that 90 minutes of this was spent in the pub. Not quite a red card, but the next time this excuse offered, your memory will flic back. Your reaction will be affected by that tiny prior fib. You might say, “And don’t go to the pub afterwards”. You would have been less harsh had he come home, and said, “We went to the pub” and you’d said, “I had to deal with the kids, but thank you for telling me”.

**Once someone starts tinkering with honesty, it’s very difficult to pretend they haven’t**. That’s where tolerance comes in. What you can bear will depend on your own moral code. It might seem an innocent little lie, but you might think, why couldn’t he just be honest? Perhaps he’s afraid to confess that bath time bores him, for fear of being seen as his true, rotten domesticity-avoidant self?

From the other side of the fence, where do you draw the line? If your partner is a good provider, is that more important to you than, essentially, respect? If there’s a degree of acceptable dishonesty, we mush redefine what honest means. It implies moral backbone, straightforward conduct; being loyal, fair and sincere. Are we watering down moral codes, to forgive ourselves for not daring to show weakness? Of course, no one is perfect. Perhaps, a compromise: “I realise you don’t like bath time, but on Saturday, will you take the children swimming?”

### “Of course, you don’t look fat in that!” ###

If you’ve nothing nice to day, deal your lips. There’s no place in a relationship for brutal honesty: how about gentle, kind, considerate honesty? If your partner returns from the salon resembling an alley cat, do you say, “You look like a mangy ginger tom”, or, “It’s very different. It will take me some time to get used to it. I did think you looked lovely before.” In both cases, the wife – or husband – will get the message, but why deliberately hurt? Be kind. We respond to kindness, because it’s a feeling. 

**Telling someone they look hideous is not a feeling, it’s a thought, and should remain so**.

### “It’s fine, darling. I don’t mind your toenail clippings!” ###

If your partner has an infuriating habit, you don’t have to silently suffer, but place any criticism between layers of praise. When our reaction is emotionally violent, it’s usually because we feel vulnerable. (He never picks up this pants. He expects me to. He doesn’t respect me.) 

Screaming achieves nothing. Speak honestly, even jokily, about how you feel, and your partner might respond. “It was inconsiderate. I’m sorry.” Meanwhile, look to your own flaws: does he always hang up the damp towel you dump on the bed? We need to re-learns how to repair what’s broken rather than throw it away. **People stay together because they’ve learnt how to compromise**. 

In recent decades, we’ve become obsessed with self-help, being assertive, meeting our needs. In so doing, we’ve created a generation of monsters and triples the divorce rate. There’s an incapacity to look beyond the self. We’re unwilling to accept the foibles and flaws of others, and loathe to admit our own. This emotional immaturity makes tolerance, love, and acceptance a challenge. If it’s a choice between right and being kind, be kind and you will always be right.

### Should I share every problem with my partner? ###

Heavens, no. Do you want a partner or a parent? We need to learn to kindly parent ourselves: so our partner isn’t forced to baby us. At 35, you don’t run to someone if you cut your finder, you apply the plaster yourself. If a friend upsets you, you might mention and discuss it with your partner, but not in a hysterical manner. Of course, you’d expect their support in a serious matter, but choosing what’s appropriate to share. 

**It’s not healthy to demand from your partner what you’re not capable of yourself: to always make it better**. It’s a burden. There has to be some tension: the unknown, a frisson, and mystique. An element of privacy, and self-containment, rather than keeping a mistress. When people become extensions of each other, it’s boring, and when we get bored, we seek excitement.

### I can’t stand the in-laws. How open should I be? ###

A friend confides that early in her relationship, she criticised her boyfriends’ mother, and he burst into tears. Lesson learnt. Twenty years into marriage, she applies caution. In –laws can be tricky: most of our extreme reactions result from our own issues – perhaps, in his mother, we see what we didn’t have with our own, and it irritates. The key is to be aware of your own triggers. 

There is probably a more palatable way to state your opinion. **Honesty does have its place, providing you can compromise, and don’t expect your partner to abandon his family or friends without good reason**. Also, what kind of person are you in relationship with? If they have a friend or relative who mistreats them, but they remain deluded, how honest should you be? I keep quiet until I can no longer tolerate the behaviour. Then I say, “I won’t see that person, because I feel they’re abusive to you, and I’m not willing to witness it.” This is about being true to your own principles – but it’s a delicate line. If they insist they’re aware, it may be wise to limit comment; accept their judgement. Perhaps you kindly tolerate it and, if one day, your partner is hurt, don’t say I told you so – support them.

### Should I “confess” to painful but shaping events from years ago? ###

An eating disorder, an abortion, alcoholism: few of us breeze through life unscathed, and yet we fear being judged. If an eating disorder is current, it should be talked about, as it’s an addiction or will negatively affect the relationship. If it’s in the past, it’s in the past. It’s true that if we were all to sit in a circle and confess our sins, we’d all laugh at each other for our lack of originality. This doesn’t mean you should feel obliged to talk about every trauma. These events might be part of your experience but they don’t necessarily define you. **We have to accept that we are flawed. Only confess what you are comfortable with, and what you assess the other person will be comfortable with.**

### I’m friends with an ex. Do I have to disclose every time we talk? ###

You’d confess if you were meeting an ex for a drink, but no need to mention the odd email or char, surely? Here is the truth: you have a dishonest relationship with your partner. And yourself. Ask yourself this: why stay in touch if it failed? He’s a good friend? So why aren’t you together? There are seven billion people on the planet, why do you have to be friends with him – or her? 
It’s linked to not having the capacity to let go. It also assuages guilt if the relationship ended badly. To be friends with the person who most probably hurt you is not grown-up. **You can’t fully commit to your partner if you can’t let go.** That’s how most affairs start. The truth should be, you’re not in contact. Anything else is self-deception.

### I have a crush. Best to be open about it, right? ###
It’s impossible to go through life without feeling attracted to some or other acquaintance, but **if you value your relationship, don’t acknowledge, or discuss**. It stays in your head. Parading your lust for a third party is disrespectful and cruel; consciously or not, it makes your partner feel inadequate. Though if they don’t give a damn, there’s another problem. It’s a passive aggressive way of testing your bond. Better to ask, “Can we talk about the state our relationship?”

If you’re having something that could be classed as an “emotional affair”: sharing intimacy with another, even if it’s not physical, needs to be tackled. It’s less about a confession, and more about why you don’t have psychological intimacy with your partner and what you intend to do about it. At this point, you’re deciding whether to mend you relationship or ruin it.
