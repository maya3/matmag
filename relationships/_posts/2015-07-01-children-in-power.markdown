Children are handed over too much power, this is a conclusion reached by Dr Robin Bernan, an US psychiatrist witnessing too many parenting problems in her practice and now published a bestseller “[Hate me Now, Thank Me Later, How to Raise Your Child with Love and Limits]”. 

Children were used to be seen, but not heard, but now they are centre of universe. **We are afraid of saying no to our kids and try to befriend them, rather than parent.** As a result we constantly negotiate with them and they exhaust us with their demands. The kids’ needs are more central than our own. Dr Bernan wrote this book to help parents to find a middle ground. It’s still important to have their needs to take an important central place, however crucial not to forget about our role as in charge, as parents.  

Nowadays we grow dependent, more entitled, more risk averse and less resilient kids. In her book Berman mentioned some ways where parents have got it wrong. We indulge our children’s demands, enter in endless negotiations about everything, and don’t let them fail in case it hurts their self-esteem. In nutshell, we have given them too much power. **Children need limits more than they need indulgencies and parents need to stop over-involvement in kids’ lives.** A good parent’s job is to allow a child to become frustrated and work some things out for themselves rather for relying on a parent for sorting everything out.

Parents put too much stress on children to achieve by obsessing over their sporting or academic accomplishments. A little stress can boost performance, but too much can lead to anxiety. We should let go of fear and anxiety. Doing the best for your children is, a lot of times, allowing them to do for themselves. This approach will make you unpopular, Bernan says, but kids will grow in psychologically stable and resilient adults.

Being a mother, a psychiatrist and a parenting group leader, helped Berman to draw conclusions about parenting methods in her book. Bernan’s advice is gained credibility due to her high ranks in profession – being an Associate Professor of psychiatry at the University of California, Los Angeles, she also runs her own private practice and teaches Reflective Parenting, developed from the work of psychoanalyst Peter Fonagy at the Tavistock Clinic in London. Reflective parenting allows parents talk about their parenting issues and reflect on them with the help of psychoanalysts, so they can do it differently next time.   

The beauty of parenting, she says, is that it’s never too late to right things.
