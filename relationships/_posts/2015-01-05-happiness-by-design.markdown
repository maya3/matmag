Professor Paul Dolan, a London School of Economics academic, a former member of the Cabinet and a part of National Statistics, well-being team, published a book “Happiness by Design: Finding Pleasure and Purpose in Everyday Life” where he explained why most of us are not as happy as we could be and how we can change ourselves.

We believe in grand, big life goals to bring us happiness, but actually subjective, everyday life experiences do make us happy. As an example, having children does not itself bring a meaning in one’s life, but those everyday interactions, like bed time stories, shared conversations bring that purpose to life.  

### Pleasure and purpose ###

There are two central issues in the study of happiness. The fist is a classic distinction, which goes back at least to Aristotle, between two views of the good life: a life of pleasure, contentment and other positive feelings, or one that is well-lived and meaningful. A clear choice of one over the other has its problems. A preference for joy over meaning gets you labelled a hedonist, which is not a compliment. On the other hand, you are called a scold if you proclaim pleasure is frivolous and only virtue and meaning matter. How should you define happiness if you wish to be neither a hedonist nor a scold? 

### Three D’s – Decide, Design and Do ###

There are three essential happy-making steps laid out in Happiness by Design: the three ds – decide, design and do. Once you have decided what gives you purpose and pleasure, the next thing is to design and prime your environment so it is easier to do the pleasurable the purposeful activities that will make you happier. He offers sound advice on how to make these choices and how to follow through them. The rest, he says, is up to you.

### Dolan’s 7 point guide to serenity ###

1.	Being happy means experiencing pleasure and purpose, and getting the balance between them right – so engage in an activity that you find fulfilling if you have a lot of fun, and have some fun if you are already engaged in lots of fulfilling activities
2.	You are what you attend to – so pay attention to good stimuli such nature and music, and withdraw attention from bad stimuli such as constant Facebook updates
3.	Lost happiness is lost for ever – so don’t hang around at an annoying film or party, or in an annoying relationship or job
4.	Small changes can have big effects – so spend five minutes more each day outside, or 10 minutes more talking to a friend
5.	You make mistakes – so get feedback on what makes you happy and does not
6.	You are a creature of habit – so shake up you immediate environment to change your behaviour, for example by changing your home page, journey home
7.	You might quite like tips for happiness, but it is the insights behind them that matter most, so think about how you can design your own environments to find your own balance of pleasure and purpose
