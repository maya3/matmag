Following a Relate study that one in four of us has had an affair, Flic Everett from The Times asks the experts if we can really safeguards our relationships. The original article published in The Times on 16 August 2014.

A recent study from Relate suggest that there is a 25% chance that an affair may happen to a married adult. Nowadays, most affairs begin at work, and many couples’ lives a stressful matrix of childcare, money management and social arrangements, there’s no guarantee that there won’t be three people in your marriage at some point. Fortunately, there are ways of making that far less likely – because when it comes to affairs, prevention is infinitely better than cure. It is almost impossible to predict what the warning signs will be in each individual couple, because only the people in a marriage know what is normal for them. The rules below apply to men and to women, as both sexes behave in largely the same way when cheating and when cheated on.

### Don’t  become invisible to each other ###

“People in long-term relationships can often feel that they have become invisible to each other”, says the psychologist Emma Kenny. “It happens almost imperceptibly”. When it does, and if someone else comes along, that’s when you’ll be tempted. “That’s why good communication is essential – and that means actively wanting to spend quality time with each other,” she says. “**Real communication** isn’t just about discussing the children, work problem or money – **it’s about knowing and liking each other**. Your partner should be your absolute best friends, the person you turn to for support or advice – it’s a good relationship when you confide in each other and have fun, no matter what else is going on. If you’re beginning to turn away from each other, that’s a warning sign”.

### Look your best ###

“People think their partner should love them whatever they look like”, Kenny says. “Why should they?” Having a good relationship can be the most important job you’ll ever do – and generally, if you have an important job and you stop bothering to try or present yourself well, you will get sacked. In relationships, though, we expect that we can look and act our worst and then we’re surprised that our partner is attracted to someone else”.

Of course, we age, and may be ill, but what holds you to the initial attraction is your partner’s appearance, Kenny says. “How they feel about themselves, whether they take care to please you – and if they put on five stone and lie around in a stained dressing gown, then of course resentment will creep in, on both sides.” And if you stop bothering, that’s when someone else who does make an effort – and who appreciates the way your partner looks – will be noticed.

### Avoid opportunities to stray ###
“People don’t have affairs without opportunity,” says Henry Benson, of the Marriage Foundation. “Everyone goes through bad patches and if there’s alternative, it can be very tempting. Many years ago, men had more affairs than women, simply because more men were in the workplace – now it’s much more equal.” Of course, we have to go to work, “but take care not to create special confidantes, or to liven up a dull job by flirting with one special person,” Benson says, “because that’s when things can tip over into infidelity.”

And you can be deliberately careful, he insists. “A paramedic mate of mine asked his employer not to put him on shifts with a female partner. Not because he wasn’t committed to his new wife – just because he realised that all of us can fall short”. If you work away a lot, or attend conferences abroad, ask if your partner can come with you sometimes, “And if you’re selfdom home,” he adds, “you need to ask yourself whether your long absences are putting your family at risk.”

### Don’t marry someone with a history of infidelity ###
“We all think our partner is rights for us, but I’d go further and ask if they are someone who is actively faithful, Benson says. “Research suggests that people who are unfaithful either have a more relaxed attitude to infidelity or are less committed in the first place”, he says. “If you have a permissive attitude, you’re much more likely to engage in an affair.” Those hippie baby-boomers, eh? “Power in a relationship rests with the person who is least committed,” he says, “and there is some evidence that people who have more power are more confidents that they can attract alternative partners. Ultimately, the biggest factor that will protect you and your relationship is choosing well in the first place.” So if it’s not too late, “pick a partner who is entirely invested in the idea of fidelity.”

### Prioritise sex ###
“Everyone goes through times when sex takes a back seat,” Kenny says. “Both partners’ libido can be affected by children, stress, resentment… You stop concentrating on each other and sex becomes less frequent. Affection can also fall by the wayside.” However, becoming resentful house-sharers leaves a very clear path for anyone who is prepared to make your partner feel good about themselves again. “Sex is the key thing that makes your relationship more than a friendship”, she says. “It’s essential to create a bit of spontaneity and fun – date nights, a trip away. Otherwise you’re heading for trouble.”

### Flirt carefully ###
“Everyone needs positive attention”, Kenny says. “And if we’re not getting it from our partners, we will usually look elsewhere.” However, while a bit of flirting is fine if it’s just a rocky patch and we still love our partner, it’s not always easy to see the boundaries. “You’re being emotionally adulterous when you’re investing in another person,” she says, “when you’re texting, confiding in them – and not in your partner”. In fact, to many people, that’s a greater betrayal than a one –night stand. “You should ask yourself, ‘What am I lacking in my relationship? And why am I looking for it elsewhere?’ ”

### Treat your partner with respect ###
If your tone towards each other is shrill and hectoring, or you barely speak other than to snap, that’s a warning sign. If you no longer value your partner there’s a good chance they’ll find someone who apparently does.
“Basically, **people get on well if they treat the other person as important**,” Benson says. “Your attitude to one another is the most important part of the marriage. So if you no longer feel valued, or have lost respect for them, it’s only a matter of time before you become vulnerable to an affair”.

### Don’t make accusation without proof ###
Without incontrovertible evidence, be very careful of hurling accusation. “If you only have a feeling that it’s affair, you can’t accuse,” says the relationship psychotherapist Rachel Morris. “What’s your evidence? Ask yourself what it is about your marriage that makes you think your partner is having an affair. If it the emotional distance? Lack of sex? Lying? Are they jumpy? Identify exactly what it is that makes you think that an affair might be happening, when that question should be what your take to your partner, not the foregone conclusion that they are having one. 

“There are many reasons why people may be secretive. Maybe it’s the credit card, maybe it’s debt, or work – so rather than ‘How could you?’ say, ‘I need to talk to you – I’ve noticed these things and I wonder what they mean.’ “

### Take responsibility ###
If you discover that your partner has been unfaithful, you could smash up the house – or you could ask why, Kenny says. “If your partner is looking at someone else, what are attracted to? Is it that person’s freedom of spirit, is it their job, or that they’re not constantly nagging about bills?” It’s seldom as simple as the middle-aged man falling for the pretty young thing, or the beleaguered women falling for the sophisticated older man – often people are simply looking for the qualities that have gone missing from their primary relationship. “Most unhappy people in long-term relationships don’t want it to mess things up,” Kenny says, “but they are desperately searching for something they’re not getting. So what is it?”

“Once you’re past initial shock, you need to look further back,” Morris says. “An affair isn’t just ‘My partner had sex with someone else,’ it’s ‘They’ve been gone a long time emotionally, and I didn’t realise – how did we get to this position?’
“**People seldom simply decide to have an affair when their relationship is happy and functioning well**. The really hard think for couples to deal with is that both of you are culpable,” she says. “One person may have been the one who is unfaithful, but you both have to take responsibility for how that became possible.”

### Beware of the “crisis” years ###
Certain points in adult life can make you more vulnerable to an affair. Research suggests that both having small children and the empty nest when they leave are key flashpoints for an affair, as are big life stresses such as redundancy or bereavement. However, perhaps the greatest of all is that old chestnut, the mid-life crisis.

“When you’re feeling worried about ageing and losing your appeal and someone suddenly thinks you’re great it’s a lovely feeling,” Kenny says. “It makes work a bit easier, it makes the difficulties feel less difficult: understandably, around this time, women may be paying the children more attention, sex goes off the boil and both partners can end feeling undesirable.”

The fortysomething years, where you’re dealing with school-age kids, ageing parents and demanding jobs, are also the crisis years, she adds, where you’re forced to make big choices about the future. “Heading for 50, you realise that you could spend another 40 years with your current partner. You may have more money, you know who you are, maybe the kids have left – and it’s at that point that you choose to stay or go for good.” **Being aware that your life’s foundations are rocking can alert you to the possibility of an affair before it simply becomes a fait accompli**.

### Learn to forgive ###
The Relate survey found that nine out ten relationship therapists thought forgiveness was entirely possible after an affair, but only one in three ordinary people agreed. “It’s an extremely big ask on both sides to repair things after a betrayal so massive,” Morris says. “And although there are many people who stay together afterwards, often the reason they do is less about love and more simply the fear of separation. “If things are to recover properly, it’s a tow-way process – it can’t just be one person apologising forever, and it’s vital to look at why the affair happened.”

A therapist can keep both parties stable while electric emotions are firing, she adds, “but the commitment to the relationship has to be huge – you shouldn’t want to go back to where you were, because then, there was potential for an affair. So **the real question is, what do you go forward to – and you are prepared to do what’s necessary?**”

### Know when to leave ###
“Sometimes an affair happens because people can’t see another way out of failing relationship,” Kenny says. And it’s as important to know when to go as when to stay, she adds. “If you can’t be happy, walk away. Don’t waste time working on something that’s over – it will cost you both too much in the long run.
“If the affair was the culmination of years of unhappiness, it can finally free you both to be happier with someone else.”
