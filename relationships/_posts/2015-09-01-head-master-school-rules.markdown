This is an extract from Tony Little’s (ex- Head Master of Eton College) book An Intelligent person’s Guide to Education. He gives a comprehensive advice to parents on child’s education. The extract is below.


### The 10 questions every parent should ask a school ###

These are the questions I would ask of my child’s school. If the answers are brisk or bland, be suspicious.

1. Is eye contact good when you walk around the school? Both pupils and adults? Do teachers greet each other warmly? Do pupils feel they matter?

2. Is there a commitment to an all-round education? Is the school driven by exam results?

3.	Does the head inspire confidence? Does he enable teachers to do a proper job or is he a control freak? Do pupils know who the head is when he walks around? (This is not as daft a question as it may sound.)

4.	Is the school committed to the continuing professional development of its teachers?

5.	Are the teachers inspiring? Do parents feel the teachers really know their child?

6.	Do the facilities facilitate? Glossy brochures do not always convey the reality. It may be a multimillion-pound academy, but does it have enough classrooms? A shabby room with an old blackboard can be the home of great teaching.

7.	Do the published statistics make any sense? A marketing person can “prove” pretty much anything. Standardised tables of inspection, such as league tables, are more reassuring, but should come with a health warning. What has been measured and how?

8.	Is there time for pupils to experiment and also have time out? What opportunities are there for pupils to participate in things beyond their usual experience?

9.	Can a pupil learn to be him or herself?

10.	Does the school show off its swards and badges? If so, avoid. As a rule of thumb, the display of badges is in inverse proportion to the quality of the school. And don’t bother with the prospectus: it will be lovely, but they all look the same. Trust your instinct!


### The 10 questions every parent should ask themselves ###

1.	Do I believe my child is almost perfect?

2.	Do I like rules and regulations until my child breaks them?

3.	Am I happy gossiping about the school to anyone, but reluctant to talk to the head?

4.	Do I go in at the deep end when someone criticises my child?

5.	Am I an expert because I went to school? 

If the answer to any of the above is “yes”, please find another school.

6.	Am I prepared to work with the school and pull my weight?

7.	Can I strike a balance between being a Velcro parent and a ghost?

8.	Can I support my child and support the school through difficult times?

9.	Can I suppress my frustrated ambitions and let my child be herself?

10.	Will I deflect rumour and find out the facts from the school?

If the answer to any of one of questions 6 – 10 is “yes”, welcome. We will be able to work with you and your child will flourish.


### How parents should behave ###

When facing stressful moments, remember that, in neurological sense, your adolescent child is , literally, not all there.

1.	Keep up regular conversations, however resistant your teenager may be.

2.	If talking at home is a problem, try a car journey with just the two of you and no eye contact. It is surprising how much is revealed in a car!

3.	Honesty is key. Be consistent.

4.	Especially with boys, deal with one issue at a time. On no account allow yourself to be fired up and say, “And another thing …”

5.	 Get to know your teenager’s friends.

6.	Listen!

7.	Criticise their behaviour, not them. Adolescents really need to feel loved.
