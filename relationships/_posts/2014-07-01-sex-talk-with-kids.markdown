According to a survey by online security company AVG Technologies, 74 per cent of UK parents talk to their children about sex by age 11 – much earlier, they said, than they had experienced such discussions themselves. But this is still too late, argue the experts, when one in three ten-year-olds have seen explicit material on the internet. In fact, the whole notion of one conversation is wrong; sex education needs to start early and continue gradually, days Lucy Emmerson, co-ordinator of the Sex Education Forum. “You’re aiming to create an openness of communication so the transfer of knowledge will happen in a drip, drip way without a bit fuss,” she says.

For those who worry that it’s too much, too young, research shows that countries with the most explicit early sex education, such as Sweden and the Netherlands, have teen pregnancy rates four or five times lower that the UK, which still has one of the world’s highest even though it’s falling. “It’s one of the great paradoxes,” says sexual health educator Suzie Hayman. “If you are more explicit with them, you arrive at the position you want – where sex is seen as part of a loving relationship. The anti-sex education brigade say they want sex as part of love and marriage but their position leads to precisely the opposite result.”
So, what should you tell them and when?

### Under 6 ###

Sex education starts when a child asks the first question, which could be as young as two or three. “A typical 3-4-year-old question is where babies come from, which startle parents who panic that they now can have to give a whole biology lesson,” Emmerson says. “But at this age they’re not interested in sperm and how it got there. So you can simply say, “You were in Mummy’s tummy, you grew from a tiny egg and then you come out.”

Be open to their questions about the body: how boys and girls are different, and use proper names for body parts. Stress that these areas of the body are private.

At aged 5-6, if they ask ‘Where does a baby come from?’ Emmerson suggests saying: “A little tiny seed from Daddy’s penis gets to Mummy’s egg and makes a baby.’ They are likely to be happy with that.”

### Ade 6-8 ###

By aged 7 they will be learning at schools about mammals’ life cycles, that it takes a man a woman to make a baby, plus the correct names for body parts. “Children of six and seven are still too young to know about sexual intercourse,” Emmerson says. “So if they ask, ‘But how does the baby get into Mummy’s tummy?’ you might say it grows from a tiny egg. The egg is in Mummy, and Daddy’s penis holds the sperm, and they come together to make a baby.”

Children of 5-7 become intensely interested in how bodies change at puberty and it’s important not to shut questions down, says James Dawson, the author of a book about puberty for boys [Being a Boy]. “Explain that with mammals you need an egg and a seed – Mummy gives the egg, Daddy gives the seed. Talk about how this something that grown-ups do when they love each other. Parents sometimes worry this is too much too young but I’ve discovered that children are very good at self-censoring: they know what’s appropriate for them and how much they want to know”.

### Age 9 -11 ### 

At school in year 5 or 6 they will learn the mechanics of reproduction and about sex for pleasure – including wet dreams and masturbation, which startles many parents. 

“If they are asking questions, eight is the right age to talk about the mechanics”, Dawson says. “This is the final step – putting the penis and vagina together. I wouldn’t leave it any later than ten as by then they will have heard Chinese whispers”.
He says by year 5 and 6 almost all his pupils already knew but there were still some mysteries, such as why people have sex if they don’t want a baby. “To explain that people do it because it feels good is the final piece of the puzzle I was able to put in place for them”.

If they haven’t asked about the sex by nine or ten, it’s worth checking what they know and make time for casual conversations. If you need help, the sexed bibles for parents are Robie Harris’s [Let’s Talk About Where Babies Come From] for 7-10s and [Let’s Talk About Sex] for 9+.

### Age 11+ ###

By now they will know about puberty and reproduction, so it’s time to make sure they understand that people don’t just have sex to make babies, which is essential before conversations about contraception, pornography and their own first sexual experiences.

“Introduce these subjects before it’s on their agenda; if you leave it till 14 or 15 you may well be closing the stable door,” Hayman says. Until now, all the talk has been focused on sex as something “adults do” but now you can begin to personalise it. “Explain the different forms of contraception and say that if you and a boyfriend one day get lose and decide to have sex, you must use contraception – and definitely a condom to prevent infection,” she says. Children of this age hate the idea of their parents having sex, so never refer to your own sex life as an example, but don’t hid affection with your partner from them.

By 11 or 12 you should begin in-depth discussion about sex in relationships which will give them the moral framework to decide when they want to have sex and with whom. It’s something schools don’t have to teach; legislation was thrown out this year, so parents are on their own. “You might talk about what it does to a relationship, should you wait – and if so until when?” Hayman says. “Discuss issues around consent and sexting – 60 per cent of teenagers (in an NSPCC study) said they had been asked for an explicit selfie and they often feel they can’t say no or the boy won’t be interested in them. Ask your daughter: what would you do? How would you feel?

Use any situation as a springboard (what educators cringingly call “teachable moments”) – drama plotlines, new stories, experience of friends or work colleagues and keep the tone non-judgemental while imparting your values. “It has to be a constant conversation running in the background from age 10 or 11, not a lecture”, Hayman says.

Jo Sharpen, who moderates the government’s online forum [thisisabuse.org](https://www.disrespectnobody.co.uk/), says it’s important to discuss consent because the widespread use of pornography has distorted teenagers’ views of sex. “Many girls think if you are in a relationship you automatically consent to anything”, she says.

### Talking about pornography ###

According to a survey of 300 14-24-year-olds by Dawson last year, two thirds learnt more about sex from pornography than sex education. Ideally, we should tell children about the existence of pornography in vague terms at eight or nine, says Hayman, just after we’ve told them about sex. “If you’ve introduced the idea of sex as a special cuddle that adults do, when they come along at eight and say, ‘What’s porn?’ you’ve laid the foundations for answering – that some people like to see pictures of this but it can be nasty and unpleasant and if you ever see anything that makes you feel confused or isn’t loving, then come and talk to me,” Hayman says.

It’s not enough to tell children what pornography is; we need to say it’s fantasy and titillation and not a real representation of sex. “We have teenagers whose first introduction to sex is through violent porn – they see anal and oral sex and assume that’s what sex is, and that women are simply there to service men,” Hayman says. “As parents it’s our responsibility to get in there first and explain what sex should be.”

If you’ve caught your child looking at porn, shaming them will only close communications. Instead, discuss what they saw, how it mad them feel, and with children over 11 talk to them about the porn industry: how porn sites are free but they are harvesting and selling you details and making money out of you, which is a line of argument that appeals to righteous teens.
