Notes on file:

1. Structure:
- main template - default, this includes head, header, footer, sidebar, content.
Draft default template saved in jekylltempl/_layouts/default. It differs from the one is going to be used: on sidebar - it includes elements I removed from project version: newsletter, popular posts, video wid, reviews
- content will inject 3 different views. These are: home page(index in root), post per categories list, single post view (post_fancy with img, post - w/out img).     
- all posts are in posts/. Categories - fixed


2. Tags
- posts are with tags;
- index on tags in tags.html root (but not linked to anythere), generates a list of all tags with links to individual tag pages;
- tags: for each tag folder tags/tag1/index html created with posts per a tag
