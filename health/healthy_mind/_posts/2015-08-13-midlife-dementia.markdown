Midlife dementia. Premature memory loss is on the rise says a new study. John Nash from The Sunday Times reports in the increase in middle-aged brain fade'.  

## Dementia is now diagnosed much earlier ##

Scientists now say that our memory generally begins to fail at the tender age of 45. 

It's a fact of life, but the disturbing thing is that failing mid-life memory could also be the first sign of premature dementia. Dementia is now regularly being diagnosed in people in their late 40s, according to a Bournemouth University study of health figures from 21 countries. 

## Why is it happening? ##

It seems there is no a single culprit, but rather a brew of factors in our lifestyles and environment such as a soup of toxic environmental chemicals, widespread use pesticides. There is not much we can do about changing our environment, but other expert suggest different factors – many of which we can change – such as over-reliance on new technology, junk foods, bulging waistlines and convenience-added lifestyles.

## Mid-life memory loss inevitable? ##
 
Some level of memory fade in mid-life appears to be inevitable. Tackling this problem amid an increasingly ageing population will prove “one of the challenges of this century”, says the Singth-Manoux. Her study, conducted in 2012, found a 3.6 per cent fall in the memory power of men and women aged 45 to 49. 

This minor drop, with its occasional slips and trips, is called “mild cognitive impairment” or MCI. It sounds innocent enough, but could be a very worrying sign. A long-term Dutch study in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease warned last year that people with middle-age MCI are significantly more likely to develop dementia than the rest of us. 

About half of people with MCI will go on to get dementia – though that may be many decades later. Others with MCI will remain healthy. No one yet knows what makes the difference.  

## When is a memory loss a worrying sign? The “aha” effect ## 

The “aha” test can answer that question. If you forget a word, but can feel it on the tip of your tongue and then recall it with a sense of “Aha! That’s it”, your reaction is healthy. This sense of recognition tends to fail with dementia.  Growing numbers of people are seeing medical experts about memory problems, according to Professor Michael Sailing, a neuropsychologist at the University of Melbourne. He says that the vast majority merely suffer from something psychologists have labelled “security protection code overload”. 

## Digital life do not make it easier for memory ##

The “worried well” feel overwhelmed by the numbers, codes and operating systems they need to know merely to function in a computer-dominated environment. We may indeed blame technology for exacerbating mid-life memory loss, according to Dr Itiel Dror, a senior cognitive researcher at University College London. “I don’t use my memory as much now. No one memorises telephone numbers any more they are stored on our phones. As we offload ever more of our cognitive functions on to technology, we use them less and have declining abilities”.

## Use it or lose it ##

“Our brains are basically ‘use it or lose it’”, he says. “If you’re used to sat-nav now, you may find yourself lost without GPS, through having lost spatial awareness when driving and not paying attention to the surroundings. Memory is not needed as much. There is a big, difficult questions over whether there is a danger in this”.

To safeguard our brains, Dr Dror recommends that we ensure that we are regularly challenged. “This does not mean sitting at home doing puzzles and memorising phone numbers. It could be doing something like gardening, where there is imagination and planning, as well as physical exercise – a variety of abilities”, he says. “It’s about getting blood-flow to your brain and cognitively being active – anything that challenges you and makes you think”.  

## Benefits of mid-life brain ##

As we grow older we become wiser and more contented. Research suggests that the middle-aged mind is calmer, less neurotic and better able to sort through social situations. Some middle-aged people even have improved cognitive abilities. The Seattle Longitudinal Study, which has tracked the mental abilities of thousands of adults over the past 50 years, has found that middle-aged adults perform better on four out of six cognitive tests than those same individuals did as young adults.

While memory skills and brain speed both decline, verbal abilities, spatial reasoning, simple maths abilities and abstract reasoning skills all improve in middle age. This helps to explain why a flight-simulator test of pilots aged 40 to 69 in the journal Neurology found that, while older pilots took longer to learn to use the simulators, they did a better job than their younger colleagues at avoiding collisions.

## Too many life events to remember… ##

When we can’t remember things, very often the problem is not in the storage, but in the retrieval.  Scientists used to think that we lost 30 per cent of our brain cells through ageing, but recent studies show that the loss is much smaller. Instead, advancing years can bring a drip in the levels of chemical neurotransmitters in our brain. Research also shows that much of what we learn in the form of chemical messages is not missing; it just gets misplaced. Our internal librarian gets less efficient. Hence that frustrating sense of “it’s in there somewhere, dammit” when names, facts and figures tantalisingly elude our grasp. In experiment, Professor Conway developed interesting method showing that the problem with middle-aged brain was one of retrieval rather that loss. The SenseCam is a wearable camera that reacts to changes in the wearer’s environment and movement, taking pictures of their changing daily experiences that may be used as cues to remind them months or even years later. 

“What do we mean by forgetting? It may be that we can’t find the cues needed to access something that’s gone into long-term memory”, he says. “When we started using the cameras, a colleague was very sceptical. That was until I showed him a photo his SenseCam had taken at a conference a year before. He suddenly remembered the exact music track that had been playing on this iPod when the photo was taken”.

Rather than filing to store things in our memory, the opposite may be the case, he adds: “The older you get, the more there is in your memory. Also as we get older, we experience the same sort of environmental cues – such as being in a certain place – again and again. So one type of memory cue can link to a lot of different memories. It can get confused”. For many of us the problem, according to Conway, is not that we are forgetting too much. It could be that we have remembered too much. Such are the trials of a rich and abundant life – even if you’re only halfway through it.
