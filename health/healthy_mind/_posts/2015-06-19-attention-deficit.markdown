What too much screen time does to your brain? 
Our attention span is now just eight seconds because of our reliance on smartphones and tablets. 
Humans now have a lower attention span than goldfish, according to new research. 

A study by technology giant Microsoft has found that we stay focused for a mere eight seconds - goldfish can manage nine - before we are distracted by phone calls, social media alerts and news on the news feed on our computers. This has a detrimental effect on our productivity. We seem to be more productive by multitasking, but the effect is quite opposite. It does not help concentration by switching back and forth from one task to another. It gets more time to come back to where we were before. One study estimated that it takes the brain 15 â€“ 25 minutes to get to where it was before switching over to check an email or take a telephone call. 

Technology impacts teen life even more than for any other generations. On average teens text their peers more than talking to them face to face. The digital life has a negative effect on our lives, the only solution is to turn off all digital devices in order to switch off destructions. Even 15 minutes will help to reenergise the brain and help any deep thinking. When you focus you are using an area of the brain called the pre-frontal cortex and you gain access to all creative thoughts, and being able to perceive more accurately the emotions of others. To achieve the true excellence in everything you do, you really need to be able to concentrate.  

How can concentration be improved?

- Switch devices off, say experts. When focusing one is using an area of the brain called pre-frontal cortex which enable to gain access to deep thinking like creative thought. You literally have to turn off your phone off and work with just one screen to do deep thinking. If working in an open plan office, having headphones on can help with blocking unnecessary auditory distructions.

- Getting more physical activity could increase the length of a person's attention span was suggested by a [study](http://www.unh.edu/healthyunh/blog/2013/07/recent-study-ties-physical-activity-longer-attention-span) from the University of Granada in 2013.

- Meditation. The [study](http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/news/releases/meditation-helps-increase-attention-span.html) by the Association of Psycological studies found in 2010 that people who mediatate can improve their concentration. 

- Do hard and creative work in the mornings when that requires deeper thought when our brain is still fresh and energetic. Then urgent and important things next and emails and everything else last.

-	Use nature healing power. A walk in a green space can calm the brain and improve attention, a study by scientists at Heriot-Watt University and the Universtiy of Edinburgh in 2013 claimed.
