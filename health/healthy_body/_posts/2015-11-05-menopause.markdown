Stop moaning and take control of your hormones, health and happiness. Menopause is unavoidable and women start feeling it as early as in their 40s when the first symptons of perimenopause, a period leading to menopause, start to show. 
 
#### What are solutions to help easing its symptoms? ####
- **HRT**
Fluctuations of hormones wildly begin somewhere after the age of 40, in the perimenopause, the period leading to menopause. The International Menopause Society, made up of endocrinologists and gynaecologists, now recommends intervention in the form of lifestyle changes, and earlier use of HRT - in low doses - to reduce the fluctuations and keep oestrogen levels boosted for longer. They say these hormone-balancing therapies will not only halt the progression of symptoms, but will provide more years of protection against conditions such as osteoporosis and heart disease. Though taking HRT should be with a caution, a major study published in 2002, the Women's Health Initiative trial, found that it increased the risks of heart disease, stroke, blood clots and breast cancer. Subsequent studies and re-analysis of the data have suggested these dangers might have been exaggerated. 

- **Bio-identicals**
Alternative to HRT is 'bio-identical' hormones made from plant extracts (rather than animal origin), claiming they more 'closely mimic' natural hormones and have fewer side-effects. They are not, however, regulated.
There few specialist clinics offering them in the UK: [Marion Gluck clinic] and [Dr Yehudi Gordon]. They are expensive and have mixed reviews.

- **Diet**
Cut back on refined carbohydrates. Women who consume lots of high sugar food and drinks (including wine) are more likely to produce poor-quality eggs, which in turn pump out less oestrogen, potentially making perimenopausal symptoms worse. Cut back on caffeine, more than 3-4 caffeinated drinks a day can make hot flushes worse and bad for bone health.

- **Moderate exercise** 
Aerobic exercise, swimming or cycling: exercise that that gets you out of breath is good for your heart, but resistance is also good for maintaining muscles and bone density. 

There are also good resources of help to how to maintain the good hormonal balance in more natural way. Read more about
