[Your Hormone Doctor] is among the best-sellers on the latest anti-aging. Best on the latest research in aging [Your Hormone Doctor] will show how to adapt to your changing hormones and make the right life style choices in growing young with a happy life:

-	#### What causes aging? ####
The lifespan of your cells is partly fixed by telomeres , the caps at the end of chromosomes that protect them from damage. Each time the cell divides, the telomeres are getting shorter, and when they become too short, the cell dies. This is an aging at the cellular level. This process is governed by both hereditary and environmental factors. You can boost the length of telomeres by improving diet, avoiding stress. 
It’s known that vitamins C, D and E, and omega-3 and -6 fatty acids, and daily exercise boost telomerase, the enzyme that makes our telomeres grow longer.
	
- #### Inflamm-ageing ####
Your body (especially, those fat cells around your middle) produces inflammatory chemicals and free radicals, which damage cells. Oestrogen protects against inflammation, so the menopause worsens it. You can protect against it with exercise, sleep and good food – antioxidant-rich vegetables, fruit, garlic, ginger, fibre, magnesium, omega-3 oils, nuts and coconut oil. 

- #### Your hormonal timeline ####
Levels of progesterone start to fall about 10 years before oestrogen level. As well as being key to reproduction, it’s also the calming hormone, helping to relieve insomnia and stress. Oestrogen level shift when women enter the perimenopause, which, for most women, starts after 35 and can last up to 10 years (though may not notice symptoms until forties). Many women experience worse PMT, weight gain, migraines and heavier periods. Hot flushes affect up to 80% of women, usually towards the end of perimenopause. Hypnosis and daily servings of soy, black cohosh and liquorice can help. On the whole, perimenopausal oestrogen levels are higher. However, without the balance of progesterone, it creates “oestrogen dominance”, causing foggy thinking and forgetfulness. To rebalance, eat cruciferous veg – broccoli, spinach, kale – and citrus fruit. Fat cells make oestrogen, so boost your intake of insoluble fibre to bring any excess and keep weight healthy.

In youth, oestrogen drives fat to your thighs and hips, where it’s locked in to provide fuel for pregnancy. Post-menopause, when oestrogen level finally fall and your periods stop, fat heads for the waist and arms, and is similarly locked in. Depleted oestrogen can also cause thin, dry skin, thinning bones, hair loss, tiredness and a slower metabolism. Testosterone levels rise, which reawakens libido, but also causes hairs on chin, a deeper voice and more fat to sit on the waist and around your internal organs. The good news, is it also lifts mood, and may help to reverse the reduced muscle mass and weaker bones common in postmenopausal women. Do consider HRT – it is not medically advised for all women, but thing have changed since the breast-cancer scare a decade ago. The alternative to synthetic and animal-derived HRT is bioidentical hormone therapy from plants such as yams, which copies your own hormones. 

- #### Watch your weight ####
At 40, your metabolic rate has fallen by about 10% and your hunger hormones start fallen by about 10% and your hunger hormones start workings overtime, especially if you’re menopausal. You need less food, yet you want to eat more. Don’t panic: new research shows you can control weight lain by condensing your meals into a time span of about eight hours, because your body isn’t full of sugar, you burn fat while you sleep. If a 16-hour fast is ambitious, 12 will do (and that means even wine, juice and milk are out). What’s more, night owls eat, on average, 248 calories more per day than those who go to bed earlier, most of them racked up after 8pm. So tuck in at breakfast – it boosts metabolism by up to 10% and is the meal that most suppresses the hunger hormone ghrelin. Go for protein – people who eat eggs for breakfast are less hungry all day (also yogurt, nuts, avocado, smoked salmon).  And key to healthy metabolism is not getting too hungry, because it raises cortisol levels. Fat burning foods – fish oils, fruits, vegetables and whole grains, spice, green tea and cafffeine, protein, dairy foods, nuts, dark chocolate – ensure you can eat plenty, but not gain weight.

- #### Fitness ####
Strength and weight-bearing exercises can increase bone mineral density, even after the menopause. Prevention is key, as nothing can turn weak bones back into strong ones. Weight or resistance training also protects your muscles, which we start losing at about 45, at a rate of 1% a year. Fitness can make you smarter, too – it’s important in avoiding mental decline than intellectual puzzles. 
Even walking can improve memory.

- #### Sex ####
When you fall in love (and lust), you produce lots of bet-phenylethylamine, a neurohormone that boosts the effect of dopamine, a brain chemical that creates a sense of wellbeing and pleasure. It also rejuvenates by increasing motivation, energy and the desire to connect with others. Even better, it curbs your appetite and boosts metabolism. The hormone oxytocin promotes sleep and relaxes.

- #### Anti-age your face ####
In the first five years after the menopause, you can lose 30% of your collagen. Hormone-induced bone loss can be up to 20%, making your skull literally shrink, while a decrease in elastin sees skin lose thickness and firmness. Facial fat starts to sink, creating jowls and hollow eyes and cheeks, so weight loss of more than 10lb can make you look older – fat is a natural filler. Retinol-based creams, retinoic acid and topical vitamin C all improve skin texture and pigment, while scientific studies show that longer eyelashes and smelling of citrus can give the impression that you are six years younger. That’s almost as much as a full facelift.
