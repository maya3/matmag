### THINK BEING 54-YEARS YOUNG IS TOO HARD? THINK AGAIN ###

Thorbjörg’s bestselling book has reached cult status when she encouraged the women to take a new natural approach to aging without resorting to plastic surgery or injectibles. “40+ is the age of the beginning of your new sexy years”. What is her secret? The programme features delicious recipes, invigorating exercises, nutritional advice, tests to see how well you are progressing. To help you to stay true on the path there are case studies from women those lives were changed thanks to Thorbjorg’s programme.

### Who is she? ###

The 54-years-young, Icelandic Thorbjörg is an expert in lifestyle changes and specialises in anti-ageing and how it's hot to be vital for life. She is a trained nurse, nutrition therapist and certified coach with 25 years of experience in nutritional therapy. She is a sought-after lecturer and teacher working in hospitals, sports academies, and with national health projects in Iceland and Denmark. 

### Brocolli & Botox ###

In 2012 Thorbjörg tested her programme publicly on Danish TV. On ['Botox versus Broccoli'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rJxq6yEbjw), Thorbjörg coached the broccoli team with her programme of nutrition, lifestyle and exercise (the other team went under the needle). After a mere 8 weeks the broccoli team were deemed to look younger by viewers than a rival treatment enhanced crew. 

## Aging the Nordic way: 10-way plan ##

* Get rid of food that ages you: all sugar, white carbs (especially bread) and processed food
* Eat like a cave woman: proteins, greens, oils, wholefoods (nuts, seeds, fruits and vegetables), wholemeal grains (in moderation).Establish your gluten and diary sensitivity.

#### Drinks ####

* Water, green tea, vegetable juice and start your day with Thorbjorg’s supersexy smoothies (banana, berries, whey protein, good oils)
* 1-2 glasses of wine every now and then are OK, three is not.

#### Exercise ####

* Find your kind of exercise, such as: push-ups, sit-ups, yoga, walking, jogging, dancing
* Exercise and sex complement each other. Life after 35 should be lit by the flames of passion
