A recent poll by Coloplast found 35 per cent of women suffer from the embarrassing problem, stress incontinence – bladder leakage caused by pressure on the pelvic floor muscle from running, exercising, laughing and coughing, yet almost half are too embarrassed to seek help.

The most common cause is pregnancy because of the weight of the womb bearing down on the bladder. It also affects woman who had never had children. Exercise could be part of the problem.
Most people concentrate on toning muscles that look good but the pelvic floor is the foundation of everything. It affects our balance, posture, bladder control and sexual sensation. If you work your upper abs like crazy or do lots of impact sport like running and don't strengthen the pelvic floor, you'll weaken it.' The problem is easily rectified with physiotherapy. 

A number of celebrities have spoken about post-pregnancy incontinence. Last November, Kate Winslet admitted on The Graham Norton Show, `I just can't jump on trampolines any more. I wet myself.' She was praised by women on parenting forums for being open about a common taboo. But not many know that over-working your abs can also affect it. `The pelvic floor muscles hold the uterus, bladder, vagina and rectum in place,' says Dr Julian Spinks, a GP and adviser to the [Association For Continence Advice]. “When you pee, the muscles relax and when you finish they clench again. If weak, they stop doing their job. So the impact of a cough or running can cause water to leak”.  Most exercises involve subtle squeezing motions and can be done anywhere. The NHS recommends at least ten contractions six times a day for 12 weeks. And given a strong pelvic floor also tightens the vaginal muscles it results in better sexual sensation – for her and for him.

### FLOOR PLAN ### 
Jenni Russell, author of [Pelvic Floor Secrets], has put together three discreet exercises you can do every day to help strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. 

**Waiting for a train**
#### BIG BELLY BREATHING #### 
To stimulate movement and awareness of the pelvic floor, while you are standing, take a deep breath in through the nose (try not to lift the shoulders). Feel the tummy expand, your organs move downwards and your vaginal muscles 'open'. Exhale and let your tummy shrink, feel everything return upwards and your vaginal muscles close. Try to hold this `closed' sensation for a few seconds. 

**In front of the TV** 
#### LOWER AB LEG LIFTS #### 
Lie on your back with your knees bent, feet flat. Place your hands in the small of your back. 'Set' your abs by drawing the belly button in and then raise each leg in turn. Keep the pressure on your fingers light. The more pressure your back exerts on your fingers the less stable your core is, and the more you need to draw in the belly button. 

**At your desk** 
#### SEATED PELVIC FLOOR #### 
Sitting with your knees slightly apart, imagine you are trying to stop yourself from urinating. You should feel your vaginal muscles tighten but the most important thing is not to move your legs or buttocks. If you are uncertain of the movement, imagine that you are pulling your internal muscles upwards away from the chair. Try doing some short explosive moves and some slowly where you hold the squeeze for a few seconds. Do it as often as possible.

#### Pelvic floor aid ####
There is also help in the form of device - [the PelvicToner], which apparently available on NHS presciption and reasonably priced if you are not qualified for NHS option. Though exercises are free. The choice is yours.
