You can get fit by walking. This type of exercise is gentle on joints and the best for those who have not done any exercise for a while. You can start walking at any age and any stage of fitness. Why don't you start right now? 

### How your health will benefit ###
* As well as keeping bones and muscles strong and halving your risk of colds, walking can help protect you against stroke, heart disease and breast and colon cancer, 
* It will reduce your risk of developing type 2 diabetes and help control your blood pressure and cholesterol levels. 
* For company, join a 'health walk' group, led by an experienced walker through [Natural England]. Get 
[Walking] also offers a free 12-week nationwide programme of led walks designed for beginners. 

### Now get walking ###
Stand tall, with your chin parallel to the ground and eyes focused ahead. Make sure you tighten your bottom with each step and hit the ground heel first, then roll through your foot and push off firmly with your toes. Bend your arms at a 90-degree angle and pump your elbows back and forth. Also, take small steps to build up your pace. Build up your physical and mental stamina in just a fortnight by walking short distances three or four times a week. Don't forget to pamper yourself and relax afterwards, and you'll find that you feel as good inside as you look on the outside. 

### Take it step by step ###
##### Step one #####
Plan where and when you'll walk - the school run, your journey to work, during your lunch hour, or before supper - and book your walks into your diary like any other appointment. Then you can focus on enjoying yourself without worrying about anything else. 

##### Step two ##### 
Stretch every day - see our Stretch It Out box overleaf - especially before you walk. If you have an existing condition, visit your GP before starting a new exercise regime. 

##### Step three ##### 
Walk at a constant pace that's faster than your normal speed, so you can feel your heart rate increasing, but so you can still talk - aim for 13 to 18-minute miles. Use a pedometer or plot a route on [Walkit.com]. The minimum and maximum distances suggested in our plan span most abilities - just make sure you're out for at least 30 minutes. On non-walking days, try to do something else that's active instead. 

### Exercise Plan ###

#### WEEK ONE #### 
* **1-3 MILES** 
Well done for getting out there and taking the first step! Now treat yourself to a relaxing herbal bath. 

* **2 MILES**
Or spend 15 minutes doing some hamstring and calf stretches. 

* **1-3 MILES** 
Give yourself a pedicure and make sure you smooth down any rough skin to avoid getting blisters. And, if you do suffer, stock up on blister plasters. 

* **SWIM** 
Go for a 30-minute swim or, if time is short, spend 15 minutes stretching. 

* **1-3 MILES**
If you've been walking less than two miles, try walking further this time - and if you're already on three, increase the pace a little. 

* **STRETCH** 
Spend 15 to 20 minutes stretching.  

* **2-4 MILES**
Remember, standing straight is the key to the power-walking technique. And don't forget to use your arms - pumping them helps you to walk faster. 

#### WEEK TWO ####
* **PILATES**
Book into a Pilates class. It's a wonderful companion to walking and a good way to boost overall strength. Find classes at pilatesfoundation.com. 

* **2-4 MILES**
Get a friend to join you and catch up while you exercise -you'll be amazed by how far you walk without even realising it! 

* **SWIM**
If you can fit it in, go for a 30-minute swim. 

* **2-4 MILES**
Try walking a little bit faster and further than previously.

* **STRETCH**
Spend 20 minutes stretching, and finish off with five minutes lying on your back with your eyes closed, visualising and relaxing your entire body from your toes to the top of your head. 

* **3-5 MILES**
By now your body will be finding its own rhythm and you should be feeling a difference in your pace and stamina. 

* **STRETCH**
Spend 20 minutes stretching, and try including a fit ball in your routine to help boost your core stability. 

### CONGRATULATIONS ###
**You've made it to the end of your two weeks - that's great progress.** 
To key building up your fitness, find walks that include hills and you'll burn around a third calories than on the flat, and strengthen bones and muscles, too. Walking on varied terrain like sand, grass or mud means you use more energy and muscle power. Keep walking regularly and gradually increase your dis and you'll feel more positive and energised. 

### STRETCH IT OUT ###
**To keep supple and avoid injury, make sure you do the following stretches:**

* Save those hamstrings! Stand tall with your feet together. With your right foot flat on the floor, toes pointing ahead, take one step forwards with your left leg, and flex your left foot. Bend your right knee and place both of your hands at the top of your right thigh to support your weight. Lean forwards slightly on to your right foot and sit back into the position. Feel it in your hamstring (back of the thigh) and calf. Hold for 10 seconds, then repeat on the other side. 

* Use a fit ball. Lie on the floor on your back, with your arms by your sides. Rest your legs together on the fit ball and, using your core muscles, raise your hips and pelvis so that your body forms a straight line from your shoulders to the tips of your toes. Pull in your bottom and feel your abdominals pressing towards your spine. Hold for 15 to 30 seconds, then return to the start position. Complete two sets of five to 10 raises, with a rest of one minute between sets.

### FOUR ROUTES TO A YOUNGER YOU ### 

#### THE NO – TIME WALK #### 
**If you don’t have even 10 minutes a day for walking, here's how to integrate the benefits into everyday life.** 

Walk all or part of the way to work; walk home; walk at lunchtime; walk to see friends or to meetings. Tap in the postcodes of your start and final destination and [Walkit.com] will give you a route with a choice of direct or less busy, and it will tell you the time it takes, distance, number of calories you will burn and even how much you have reduced your carbon footprint by walking. It's aimed primarily at urban walkers with circular walks, themed walks and information about what you'll see en route. The Ramblers' Association also provides free, downloadable maps of the best walking routes in major cities and the rest of Great Britain. So pull on your trainers and get moving. 

#### THE WORKOUT WALK ####
**Adding toning moves and pushing yourself to work harder will help turn your walk into a total body workout.**
Try these simple additions to improve the toning effect. Walk on grass, mud or sand, and up hills to burn more calories and help tone your hips and buttocks. When walking uphill, watch your posture, keeping the spine long. Walking downhill can be harder on your body (especially knees) than walking uphill, so slow down slightly, keep your knees slightly bent, and try to pull in your abdominal muscles to keep your pelvis stable. Use trees en route to do an upright plank: lean forward at a 45-degree angle against the tree, arms straight out, weight mainly on the balls of your feet, and pull in your stomach muscles as though you were fastening a tight pair of trousers. Hold for 20 seconds then rest for 10. Repeat four times. Do it every 10 minutes as you walk, gradually increasing the length of time you hold your tummy in. 

#### THE STRESS-BUSTING WALK #### 
**The combination of physical activity, which helps to burn off stress chemicals,** and ‘green exercise' shown to induce relaxation and boost your mood, is a potent one. 
Add mindfulness to the mix and you have a walking meditation. Walking 'mindfully' means shifting your focus from worries about the past or the future to being in here and now. From the moment you set out, become aware of the ground beneath your feet and your breathing. Don't think about what lies ahead or where you've been – pay attention to the breeze in your hair, the sun on your face and the sounds, sights and smells around you. Stay in tune with the rhythm of your breath and of each step. If thoughts distract you, simply notice them and return your awareness to your breathing. 

#### THE FAT-BURNING POWER WALK ####
**To burn fat and shed pounds, you need speed.** Power walking – at up to five miles an hour (that's a mile in 12 minutes), with your elbows at 90 degrees, pumping back and forth, helps propel you along and provides a good upper body workout. Push off each stride from the toes with a straight back leg for strength and stability. Or walk at a normal, brisk pace for 10 minutes, then increase your pace to as fast as you can without breaking into a run for 30 seconds, before returning to normal for 5 minutes. Gradually increase the length of the intervals to a maximum of three minutes with 10 minutes' brIsk walking in between. Or try one fast followed by one slower mile. To walk faster, take more steps rather than lengthening your stride, which can strain feet and legs.  

##### 45 minutes of brisk walking, four times a week over a year, could help you lose 18lb without dieting #####
