Boost your body confidence fast with these fashion cheats and tricks to flatter your shape. 

### PLAY UP YOUR BEST BITS ### 
Keep your clothing in proportion and draw attention to your best features. Show off your legs in a knee-length pencil skirt or fitted cropped trousers. Emphasise a trim waist with fitted jackets or belts. Avoid hiding under top-to-toe baggy clothes that make you look bigger than you are! 

### CLEVER DISGUISES ###
Clothes that are ruched, wrapped or draped will divert attention from any problem areas and are flattering for all sizes. A heavy jersey fabric will add support and smooth over any lumps and bumps. Three-quarter-length sleeves are slimming and a good choice if you prefer to cover your arms. 

### TUMMY TAMERS ### 
Narrow, tunic-style tops worn over slim trousers will draw the eye away from your tummy. Wear flat-front trousers to smooth and reduce a muffin top. 

### STAND TALL ### 
Fact: heels do make your legs look slimmer. But there's no need to teeter around in stilettos -wedges, platforms and chunky heels all have the same elongating effect. 

### JUST AN ILLUSION ###
Big shapes just make you look bigger, as do oversize tunics, clothes that are too small, wide belts and boxy jackets - so avoid all of these! 

### OWN ONE GREAT JACKET ### 
Long-line blazers skim over big hips and turns, while narrow sleeves slim heavy arms. Clever tailoring will define your waist. 

### BUY THE RIGHT UNDERWEAR ### 
Wearing a bra that fits properly can make the bust look smaller, so be sure to get measured. Shapewear may not be the sexiest thing in the world, but it can work wonders. Buy a vest with a control panel, high-waisted pants, or even leggings, bodies or tights, for a svelte silhouette. 

### GO MONO ### 
Dressing head-to-toe in one darker colour will lengthen and streamline the body. Try navy or grey instead of black. 

### USE BLACK STRATEGICALLY ### 
It's the classic slimming colour, so wear it on the parts you'd most like to visually slim. 

### IN YOUR JEANS ### 
Slimming denims claim to tuck tummies and lift bottoms, and really can make you feel a whole size smaller.  

### IF YOU’RE BUSTY ###
Don’t try to disguise bigger boobs in voluminous layers – a body-skimming silhouette is much more flattering. Wrap dresses are great for separating and slimming the bust (no boob shelves here!). A vertical print narrows the whole silhouette. Slim you torso with a fitted top or jacket and wide-leg trousers. Avoid empire lines, cowl necks, polo necks, ruffles, high-waisted trousers or shirts teamed with wide belts. 

### FABRICS THAT FLATTER ###
Clingy materials like jersey are best for areas you want to flaunt, while crisp tailored items in non-stretch cotton or wool will give structure to areas that you feel might be in need of a little help. 

### PERFECT YOUR POSTURE ###
‘What ages people most is a hunched posture and an inflexible spine – it not only makes you look older, but it’s also bad for your bones’, says Pilates guru Lynne Robinson. She recommends this exercise from her book [The Pilates Bible], which extends your back and tones your bottom and inner thighs at the same time.

1.	Lie on your front, on a mat, with your pelvis resting lightly on the mat, your legs straight but related and your arms resting by the sides of your body, palms facing the ceiling.

2.	Breathe in, then breathe out as you lift first your head, then you neck, chest and upper ribs off the mat. Your lower ribs should stay in contact with the mat. Lengthen your arms away and lift them slightly as they turn in, palms facing your body. Simultaneously draw your legs together so that they remain parallel and your inner thighs are touching.

3.	Breathe in as you hold the position and then out as you return your chedst and head back down to the mat, simultaneously releasing your legs and arms back to the starting position.

4.	Repeat the stretch up to 10 times.
