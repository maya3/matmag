There are ways to refresh your style and take years off by changing a one simple thing like adding a fringe or shaping eyebrows. 

### EXPERIMENT! ###
Try new shapes and styles that come into fashion - you'll never know what suits you unless you give them a go. 

### HIGH BROW ### 
Groomed eyebrows are a secret weapon to looking five years younger. The arch of your brows should be directly above the outer edge of your iris to accentuate your eyes and give your face a natural lift. 
If you want to create extra length or shape, use a pencil, and a highlighter under your arches to create a more youthful, lifted look. 

### FLATTERING FLATS ### 
Comfy yet stylish, loafers, ballet flats and classic white Converse Chuck Taylors suit everyone and look modern - you don't have to hobble around in heels! 

### MIX IT UP ### 
Do the unexpected. Play around with the classics by wearing a leather jacket instead of a blazer, teaming Converse with a shift dress or accessorise a classic cashmere jumper with statement costume jewellery. 

### FRINGE BENEFITS ### 
Side-swept, full or short fringes are on trend and looking fabulous on Claudia Winkleman and Joanna Lumley.They give a new look fast, and beat Botox for taking years off and concealing a furrowed brow. 

### SHAPE YOUR FACE ### 
Make-up artist Charlotte Tilbury maintains you can instantly slim, sculpt, shorten, trim and highlight your features with a brush and bronzer. 'Blend bronzer under the ears, along the jaw and from the chin down to the neck. If you want to slim and define your nose, use a smaller brush to sweep bronzer from beneath the brow down the nose. Then brush under the tip to lift it.â€™ 

### HAVE FUN WITH FASHION ### 
Mix designer labels with high-street and vintage pieces to create own signature style.
