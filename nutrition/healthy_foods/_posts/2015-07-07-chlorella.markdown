This protein-rich green algae boosts immunity, lowers blood pressure and provides the iron one in four of us lack, says award-dietician and health nutritionist, dietician Carrie Ruxton
	
### What is it? ### 
Named after the Greek word for 'green', chlorella are tiny single cell algae found in fresh water ponds. When dried, almost half their weight is protein, and they're also rich in vitamins and minerals. In practice, [chlorella] is difficult to produce in bulk and can't be digested in its natural state. But while it didn't take off as a foodstuff, it's available as a supplement, with multiple benefits. 


### What is it good for? ###

#### BOOSTING IMMUNE FUNCTION ####
A low dosage of [chlorella] has been shown to help fight disease. A small study of 51 healthy adults found that those who took 5g of chlorella daily for eight weeks had improved immune function. The trial, published in Nutrition Journal, saw increased levels of immune proteins that fight viruses and bacteria. A Japanese study of women taking part in an intense training camp, found that those who took 0.2g chlorella daily had a boosted immune function. 

#### POWERING UP ANTIOXIDANTS ####
In a Korean study, 52 smokers were given 6g of chlorella daily and they experienced a boost to their antioxidant levels by as much as 44 per cent. The chlorella also lessened DNA damage. It's thought to work by scavenging nasty free radicals in the body produced by cigarette smoke. 

Beware the hype though: some claim that chlorella treats and even prevents cancer by removing toxins from the body and boosting immune function, but the American Cancer Society refutes those lofty claims; there just isn't enough evidence to support them. 

#### SUPPORTING A HEALTHY PREGNANCY ####
Just 5g of dried [chlorella] contains a whopping 45 per cent of your daily iron needs, so it's no surprise that it wards off iron deficiency. In research, pregnant women* given 6g chlorella had better iron levels after five months, according to a study published in Plant Foods For Human Nutrition. 

They also had lower levels of proteinuria (high levels of protein in the urine), which is linked to preeclampsia, and oedema, linked to swollen feet. Researchers suggested that chlorella supplements 'may be useful as a resource of natural folate, vitamin B12 and iron for pregnant women'. 

#### LOWERING BLOOD PRESSURE ####
When participants with high blood pressure (linked to heart attack and stroke) took 10g of [chlorella] daily for 12 weeks, it dropped significantly. Those with the highest blood pressure saw the most benefit. 

There's no consensus as to how it works, but one trial noted that chlorella reduced arterial stiffness and improved nitric oxide levels, which is known to relax arteries. 

### How do I get it? ###
Don't go dredging your pond! Eating raw chlorella wouldn't be much use as humans can't digest the cell walls, but by smashing up the cells and drying the algae, producers make a digestible supplement or powder.
The taste is similar to green tea, sometimes a bit fishy, and be warned: it turns poo green! 

### How much do I need? ###
There's no official amount, but many studies use 5-10g daily, which equates to six or more pills or one or two teaspoons of powder added to your water, smoothie, juice, yoghurt or baking. This provides just 20 calories and miniscule levels of fat, but high levels of vitamin A, B-complex, iron and zinc. 

There are few side effects, though, like with any supplements. You can check [web.com](http://www.webmd.com/vitamins-supplements/ingredientmono-907-chlorella.aspx?activeingredientid=907&activeingredientname=chlorella) for more information.
