a leading neurologist Dr Permutter says the diet affects how your brain works. It is been known that the wrong diet with too much refinery sugars, carbs and gluten are damaging our brains, and trigger headaches, depression, ADHD.

He explains the link between healthy gut and brain and how nurturing gut health through a few easy strategies can alter brain chemistry for better. 

Dr Permutter’s theory is that the **digestive system is connected to what goes on in the brain**. 
We have not one but two nervous systems. One is linked to the brain and the spinal cord and the other is connected to the gastrointestinal tract. Both are connected via the vagus nerve, which runs from the brainstem to the abdomen. 

The gut’s nervous system plays an important role in our wellbeing. An estimated 80-90 per cent of serotonin – the feel-good chemical – in your body is produced by the gut. Both systems communicate well with each other. As an example, think of a time when your stomach felt like in knots before a job interview, or you feel butterflies in your stomach during a happy event. 

We also have a complex ecosystem living inside our digestive system called the microbiome. It is made up of trillions of microscopic living cells that aid digestion and help us to absorb nutrients, fight against viruses, neutralise toxins. They also help us to handle stress and control the body’s  inflammatory pathways, which affect the risk for chronic disease.   

**The brain is dependent on the health and diversity of the bacteria within the intestine**. These are bacteria that provide many of our brain-essential vitamins and provide short-chain fatty acids that are part of the brain’s fuel. They determine the body’s level of inflammation, and inflammation is the cornerstone of everything that goes wrong with the brain, of every neurodegenerative condition.

* Dr Permutter recommends:

1.	Avoid sugar, fat and processed foods 
When we eat food such as sugar, fat and processed foods, the gut becomes dysfunctional and inflamed, and bad bacteria proliferate. These bad bacteria emits chemicals which compromise the lining of the intestine – a condition called leaky gut – that lets viruses and toxic waste products into the bloodstream. 
If there is overgrowth of at least one type of bacteria called Clostidia which crowd out the balancing effects of other gut bacteria, leading to lower level of good bugs in the gut. In the book, Dr Permutter explains why many children with autism crave carbohydrates, especially refined sugars – the food that feed these bugs – creating a vicious cycle that fuels the proliferation of more Clostridia.

2.	Diet rich in high-fat, high-fibre and low-carb with supplement in probiotics 

3.	Drink filtered water

4.	Avoid unnecessary exposure to household chemicals

5.	Don’t use non-stick pans or cookware

6.	Avoid hand sanitisers, anti-bacterial soaps, air deodorisers and plug-in room refreshers

7.	Supplement babies’ diets with protiotics until they are old enough to eat yogurt and fermented foods

8.	 Breastfeeding is important not only from a nutrition point of view but it helps transfers good bacteria that live on mother’s skin to a baby

9.	Overuse antibiotics, particular in agriculture, means they are making their way into our food supply chain that have a bad effect on gut bacteria.
There is a lot we can do for ourselves just by improving our diet.

- Dr David Perlmutter's guide 
**The best foods to eat — and the ones to avoid**

Significant changes in gut bacteria can take place in as little as six days, depending on the current state of your gut and how fully you commit to making changes. 

- Drink red wine 
Red wine is a rich source of gut-loving polyphenols, but limit it to a glass a day for women and two for men. In moderation, wine, tea, coffee and chocolate contain nature's best medicines for supporting the health of gut bacteria. 

- Go low-carb and embrace high-quality fat 
Most people's diets are centred on grains and carbs — many of which contain microbiome-damaging gluten, the downstream effects of which reach the brain. An ideal plate on the Brain Maker diet should be a sizeable portion of vegetables and 3-4oz of protein. Fats will come from those naturally found in protein and from ingredients used to prepare the dishes such as butter and oil. 

- Pile your plate with`brain maker' foods 
These include vegetables such as leafy greens and lettuces, broccoli, spinach, brussels sprouts, green beans, bok choy, asparagus, garlic, leek, ginger, shallots and parsley. 
Low-sugar fruit avocados, bell peppers, cucumber, tomato, courgettes, squash, lemons and limes. 
Healthy fat extra virgin olive oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, grass-fed butter, almond milk, olives, 
Healthy fat extra virgin olive oil, sesame oil, coconut oil, grass-fed butter, almond milk, olives, nuts and nut butters, cheese (except for blue cheeses) and seeds such as pumpkin, chia and sunflower. Protein whole eggs, wild fish such as salmon, black cod, herring, trout and sardines, shellfish such as shrimp, mussels and crab, grass-fed meat, fowl, poultry and pork. 
Condiments mustard, horseradish, tapenade and salsa. No ketchup because it has sugar. No restrictions on herbs and seasonings. Foods that can be used in moderation include: carrots and parsnips, cow's milk and cream, beans, lentils, peas, non-gluten grains such as amaranth, buckwheat and rice (brown, white, wild). Gluten-free oats. 
Sweeteners natural stevia, chocolate, whole sweet fruit, berries. 

- Choose foods rich in prebiotics
The ingredient that gut bacteria love to eat to fuel their growth and activity. I recommend aiming for 12g daily, either from real foods, a supplement, or a combination of both. The top food sources of natural prebiotics are: acacia gum, raw chicory root, raw Jerusalem artichoke, raw dandelion greens, raw garlic, raw leek, raw onion, cooked onion and raw asparagus. 

- Get a water filter 
To avoid the gut-busting chemicals such as chlorine found in tap water. 

- Go on a fast 
Intermittent fasting — a complete restriction of food for 24 hours at regular intervals throughout the year can enrich the strains of bacteria that are associated with an increased lifespan and reduce those bacteria that have a negative impact on lifespan. My fasting protocol is simple: no food but lots of water (no caffeine). If you take any medications, continue to take them. Those on diabetes medication should consult their doctor. Fasting through the seasonal changes (for example, the last week of September, December, March and June) is an excellent practice. 

- Eat live yoghurt 
Fermented foods provide beneficial bacteria and kill off harmful bacteria. They will help to maintain the gut lining, balance the body's pH, serve as natural antibiotics, regulate immunity and control inflammation. You should regularly consume: live-cultured yoghurt, kefir, kombucha tea, tempeh, kimchi, sauerkraut, pickles, pickled fruits and vegetables, fermented meat, fish and eggs and cultured condiments such as mustard, horseradish and relish. 

- Be mindful of the products you buy and avoid added sugars, chemical preservatives and colourings. Ideally, choose organic.
