The key to eating for eternal youth seems to be a Mediterranean-style diet rich in fruit, vegetables and oily fish. There's a convincing evidence it lowers the risk of heart disease and type 2 diabetes, and may protect against some cancers and dementia. Then there are the beauty benefits. A large Australian study found those whose diets were rich in fruit, veg, nuts, beans, lentils and wholegrain bread had fewer wrinkles than those who feasted on fatty and sugary foods. 

So which foods have the greatest anti-ageing power? According to scientists at the US National Institute on Aging, those with the highest ORAC (Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity) score - or antioxidant power - are more likely to keep you looking youthful. Beans, lentils, green leafy vegetables, fruit that's red, orange-yellow or blue-purple, and dried fruit rank highest. 

### OATS ###
These contain a soluble *fibre called betaglucan* that mops up cholesterol precursors and whisks them out of the body. Eaten daily, oats can help lower cholesterol and prevent blood vessels furring up. They're also a source of *silicic acid*, needed to make the spongy cells between the skin's collagen and elastin, and which help reduce the appearance of lines and wrinkles. 

### SPINACH ### 
Green leafy veg, such as spinach, rocket and watercress, have high levels of *lutein*, which helps prevent age-related eye conditions - and may reduce wrinkles, too. 

### NUTS ###
Most are a good source of *selenium*, a potent antioxidant that reduces signs of ageing. Brazil nuts contain most - just two or three will provide your daily needs. 

### ORANGES ###
Like clementines, kiwi fruit, peppers and broccoli, oranges are rich in *vitamin C*, which may protect against ageing by mopping up damaging free radicals. A British study of 4,025 women aged 40 to 74 found vitamin C-rich foods reduced the risk of wrinkles by 36%.

### YOGHURT ### 
One (150g) pot delivers a third of your daily *calcium* intake (cheese, milk and almonds are also good sources). A healthy calcium intake (with vitamin D and weight-bearing exercise) helps to maintain bone strength and prevents osteoporosis. 

### OILY FISH ### 
Salmon, sardines and mackerel are stocked with *omega-3* fatty acids, which help lower blood cholesterol and lower your chances of a heart attack or stroke. They may also help prevent memory loss and alleviate inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, as well as reducing wrinkles, according to a British study. 

### CHICKPEAS ###
Beans and pulses rank *high on the ORAC scale*, and may also help prevent certain cancers due to their high content of phytates and phytoestrogens. 

### TOMATOES ###
The *lycopene* in tomatoes can help protect against wrinkles. University researchers found that adding 5tbsp of tomato paste to your diet daily boosts skin's levels of pro-collagen (which keeps skin firm) and improves its ability to protect against UV rays by 33%. 

### BLUEBERRIES ### 
These have the *highest ORAC score of all*, so are good at preventing cellular damage. Like strawberries, raspberries, plums and blackberries, they're also packed with *anthocyanins*, which protect against heart disease and cancer. 

### How much in OPAC units to eat daily? ###
The oldest living people consume at least 6,000 ORAC units a day. 
Add these to your shopping list - each contains 2,000 ORAC units per portion:

Blueberries, cherries, blackcurrants, raspberries, strawberries.
Pear (half), grapefruit (half).
Plum, orange or apple.
Dark chocolate (4 pieces).
Walnuts (7 halves).
Pecans (8 halves).
Pistachios (handful).
Avocado (1/3).
Broccoli (1 medium).
Asparagus (8 spears).
Red wine (150ml).
Red grapes (200g/7oz).
Cinnamon (1/3 tsp).
Oregano (½ tsp dried)
Turmeric (½ tsp).
Mustard (1 tsp).
Lentils, kidney beans (½ tin)
