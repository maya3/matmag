What is good about milkshakes? Milk's calcium keeps bones strong and healthy. It is also high in protein, making it good muscle fuel, too. In fact, recent research suggests it might be worth including whole milk in your diet, because although it's higher in fat and calories than semi-skimmed, it retains more heart-healthy vitamins.
