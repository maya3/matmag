[Ian Marber], a well-known nutrition expert, have a word of advice to those who are approaching 50. The incidence of health problems increases as we age, so here is a head-to-toe guide of some that people my age can look forward to, and how nutrition can offset the odds.

### Beetroot for the memory ###
There are more than 150,000 incidences of stroke, or brain attacks, per year in the UK, men being 25 per cent more prone, although the risk for both sexes evens out aged 55. There are many factors that can lead to a stroke, not least hypertension. Beetroot juice has been shown to reduce systolic, or maximum, blood pressure, as it contains *nitrates* (as do many medications for blood pressure, such as nitroglycerin). Nitrates act as a vasodilator, increasing blood flow and thus easing blood pressure.
How much 100g of beetroot juice.

### Kale for eyesight ###
Macular degeneration is the most common cause of vision loss in the over-50s and is more common for women. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), a US Government-sponsored trial, found that high levels of specific antioxidants and minerals could cut the risk of macular degeneration by 25 per cent and help those already affected retain vision. The original study included high levels of betacarotene, which could be associated with a higher risk of lung cancer in smokers, and so researchers changed the formula for a subsequent trial, AREDS2, resulting in focusing on lutein, zeaxanthin and zinc. Researchers also added omega-3, but concluded that it neither added nor took away from the results. Conveniently, lutein and zeaxanthin, both carotenoids, together with zinc, are found in kale.
How much 130g of cooked kale should supply the carotenoids, though only minimal zinc. Consider supplementation of no more than 25mg, but take appropriate medical advice beforehand.

### Tuna to keep the thyroid healthy ###
Thyroid function can reduce as we age, but hypothyroid is more common in women over 50, contributing to weight-gain, fatigue and feeling the cold. There are various thyroid hormones. The best known is thyroxine, yet others, such as T3, are equally important. Thyroxine is converted in the liver into its active form, T3, and requires selenium. Selenium is relatively unaffected by gentle cooking, so tuna sashimi, or lightly grilled or sautéed tuna, is recommended.
How much 113g cooked tuna offers about 120mcg of selenium (the RDA is 75mcg)

### Walnuts for the heart ###
Nuts are potent mix of fibre, plant sterols, monounsaturated fatty acids and vitamin E. Soluble fibre and plant sterols can hinder cholesterol absorption from the gut, essential fats can help reduce blood pressure and, together with vitamin E, they can reduce cholesterol oxidation. Nuts contain mostly omega-6 fats, yet walnuts are rare in that they contain alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is converted to eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DPA), both types of omega-3 fats. These help protect low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, the unwanted form of cholesterol, from oxidising and becoming more damaging, and also strengthen the artery walls, both factors contribute to a stroke or heart attack. Research by Harvard University published in 2009 suggested that cholesterol level decreased when 10-24 per cent of daily calories came from walnuts.
How much 8- 10 walnuts

### Tomato for the prostate ###
Prostate cancer can affect one in eight men, with the risk rising for men over 50. The link between prostate cancer and dietary lycopene, a carotenoid pigment, is often questioned, but recently researchers at Harvard concluded that higher lycopene intake was inversely associated with total prostate cancer. Tomatoes are an excellent source of lycopene, more readily absorbed from processed tomatoes.
How much 240ml of tomato products including tomato juice, soup, sauce, passata or fresh tomato used in cooking.

### Milk for muscles ###
A very similar part of the typical diet, regular full-fat milk can help combat the reduction in muscle mass that is associated with getting older. A 2006 study at the University of Texas found that the amino acids in whole mild, drunk after exercise, helped net muscle protein synthesis. In other words, milk ensured that muscle mass was maintained following weight-bearing exercise.
How much 237 ml or half a pint.

### Sardines for bone strength
One in four women and one in five men over 50 in the UK suffers a fracture related to poor bone density. Several factors can contribute to osteoporosis, mostly genetics, but diet is an important factor, especially calcium and vitamin D. Ideally we should be getting 100mg calcium daily from sources such as dairy, tofu and green vegetables. Vitamin D is harder to find in food, but sardines are one of few foods that contain both calcium and vitamin D.
How much 100g sardines offers 43 per cent of the RDA of vitamin D and 34 per cent of calcium.

### Beans to reduce the risk of bowel cancer ###
Bowel cancer is the fourth most common type of cancer in the UK and 90 per cent of those diagnosed are over 50 years of age. Factors that contribute to overall risk include family history, inflammatory bowel disease and diet. Processed meats and fried foods can increase the risk to some extent, while fibre and folate can reduce it. Legumes or beans contain both fibre and folate to varying degrees. Black-eyed beans, chickpeas, butter beans and kidney beans offer anywhere from 6-10g per 100g.
How much 200g beans providing up to 20g fibre – NHS guidelines suggest at least 18g fibre a day, although considerable more is beneficial.

### Turmeric for joints ###
Osteoarthritis is more common in men than women in the under-55s, yet far more prevalent in women aged 55 and upwards. Men are also more likely to experience hip pain, while knee and hand problems are common for women. Inflammation can be linked to diet, as arachidonic acid, resulting from excess protein, leads to an increase in pro-inflammatory prostaglandins and leukotrienes. However, curcuminoids, found in turmeric, can alleviate some inflammation according to research from the Saudi Arabia’s king Faisal University.
How much A generous pinch of turmeric in cooking a few times a week, or take a daily supplement (about 400mg). Alternatively, gingerols, found in ginger, have similar effects, so add fresh ginger to cooking several times a week.

### Cherries to avoid gout ###
Gout affects almost 750,000 adults in the UK, yet is more prevalent in postmenopausal women and men over 50. It is linked to raised levels of uric acid that crystallises and causes localised inflammation, especially in the joints, notable the big toe. Uric acid is excreted in the urine and can be kept in check by the hormone progesterone, which drop significantly at menopause, although the condition is not uncommon in men in their fifties. Research at the University of California published in 2003 noted that eating cherries daily increased uric acid excretion by as much as 60 per cent. The findings were confirmed in research from the US Department of Agriculture in 2013. It found that eating cherries selectively reduced several biomarkers associated with inflammation.
How much 200g bing cherries daily (about 20-25 cherries)
