Want to slim down, look youthful and give your health a boost? A Mediterranean diet delivers all these benefits, so switch to eating well... forever! 

After years of debate about what makes the healthiest diet, there's finally a clear winner. The evidence for the benefits of Mediterranean style meals has been growing, and the latest research shows beyond any doubt that this way of eating can protect from heart disease, help you live longer and makes you feel a whole lot better, too. 

Experts worldwide now believe there's something special about this diet and that making the switch could be a life-saver. But what exactly is a Mediterranean diet, and how can we incorporate it into our daily lives? 

For the people of Greece or Italy who have eaten way for centuries, it's not so much a diet as a way of life based around fresh, seasonal food that is unprocessed, home-cooked and eaten with friends and family. The Mediterranean diet contains moderate amounts of high-fat foods such as olive oil, - and nuts - all heart-healthy ingredients – balanced with smaller amounts of high-carb foods like bread, pasta and rice, along with plenty of veg. It's a different way of thinking about portions, but calories are kept in check and you don't feel hungry. In fact, you may shed pounds - fats and protein are more filing than carbohydrates, so you could well end up eating less than usual. 

### What -it can do for your health ###
The benefits of the Mediterranean diet first emerged in the 1950s, when it became apparent that heart disease was much rarer in Greece and Italy than in more northerly countries. Since then, the evidence linking a diet based on an abundance of fruit, vegetables, pulses, fish and olive oil with a reduced risk of disease — as well as health and longevity — has been mounting. 

### A LONG AND HAPPY LIFE ###
An analysis of a dozen studies involving more than 1.5 million people found that eating a Mediterranean diet lowers the risk of dying from heart disease, stroke or any other cause, and reduces the chances of developing cancer, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. 

### A HEALTHY HEART ### 
Research that found a Mediterranean diet was more effective than a low-fat diet in protecting against stroke or heart attack, was so compelling that the researchers all switched to Mediterranean eating at the end of the study. Although none of the people in the study had cardiovascular disease, all were at higher risk of it because they had type 2 diabetes, and there were other factors, such as smoking, high blood pressure, high cholesterol or a family history of heart disease. After five years, those eating a diet rich in olive oil or nuts had a 30% lower risk of having a heart attack or stroke, or dying from one, than those eating a low-fat diet. 

### A SVELTE AND YOUTHFUL SHAPE ###
Eating like this can even help you lose weight. One study found that the Mediterranean diet was the most effective when it came to weight loss. Another revealed that, after a year, Mediterranean dieters had managed to keep the weight off, while low-fat eaters had regained their lost pounds. 

### WORKS ### 
While the individual components of the diet are packed with nutrients, the magic is in the total package of brightly coloured fruit and vegetables, healthy fats, pulses and whole grains. The food is eaten as close to its natural state as possible - fresh, unprocessed, flavoured with herbs and spices, unadulterated with additives and preservatives. 

**Fruit and vegetables** are key. They are high in fibre, and bursting with vitamins and naturally occurring chemicals. Aim for seven to nine portions a day by adding a salad to every meal and fruit to breakfasts and desserts. Pulses count as a portion and are high in protein, fibre, vitamins and minerals, as well as being a good source of iron. 

**Olive oil and nuts** are the stars of the diet. Olive oil is high in monounsaturated fats, which can lower harmful LDL cholesterol and help maintain levels of beneficial HDL. Nuts are rich in monounsaturates, fibre, protein, vitamins and minerals. 

**White fish** is an excellent source of low-fat, low-calorie protein, while oily fish contains omega-3 fatty acids, which help keep your heart and arteries healthy. They reduce the stickiness of the blood, too, making it less likely to clot. They are also thought to prevent atrial fibrillation. 

A **glass of wine** with a meal is a way of life in the Med. Wine contains beneficial plant chemicals, particularly resveratrol, which help prevent damage to blood vessels, reduce harmful cholesterol and prevent clots. Resveratrol is found in grape skins, so all wines contain it, but red wine has more. 

## The Med Diet Rules ##
Here's our handy, at-a-glance reminder. The portion sizes for fish, poultry and meat are average, and reflect those used in the delicious Mediterranean recipes in our cookery section over the page. The only other rule to remember is to keep sugar, soft drinks, confectionery, cakes, biscuits and puddings to a minimum. 

### DAILY ### 
* 2 portions (2tbsp) olive oil 
* 1 portion (25g) walnuts, almonds or hazelnuts 
* 7+ portions (80-b0og) fruit and vegetables 
* 1-3 portions (150ml) dairy products 
* 3-6 small portions (25g) wholegrain bread, rice, pasta or other grains 
* 1 small glass (125m1) wine (optional) 

### WEEKLY ### 
* 2-3 portions (100-150g) fish/seafood 
* 3+ portions (15og cooked weight) pulses 
* 1-2 portions (100-150g) poultry 

### MONTHLY ### 
* Up to 4 portions (85-125g) red meat 

## MAKE IT EASY ##
Simple steps to healthier eating 
* Use olive oil in place of vegetable oil. If you’re worried about calories, buy an olive oil spray for cooking.
* Swap mayonnaise in favour of olive oil and balsamic dressing.
* Sprinkle nuts or seeds on salads rather than croutons. 
* Don't add salt, shop-bought sauces or manufactured flavouring to your food. Use fresh herbs, spices, citrus juices and wine instead. 
* Choose fresh fruit instead of juice. It's more filling and you get the benefits of the fibre as well as vitamins are minerals. Fruit sugars are also less damaging to teeth when they are contained within the whole food – the sugars are released during the juicing process.
* Forget puddings – eat fruit instead. Finish meals with a plateful for everyone to share.
* Opt for a wine box to make it easier to have one glass without feeling you have to finish a bottle.

Q + A

* Aren't nuts very high in calories? 
- Yes but they also filling, and studies show that people who eat diets containing moderate amounts are more likely to maintain their healthy weight after dieting than those who don’t. Always go for nuts in their unadulterated state, rather than the roasted, salted variety.

* The diet is quite high fat. Aren’t we meant to be eating less? 
Mediterranean diets typically consist of up to 40% fat, as opposed to the recommended 33% but according to GH nutritionist Anita Bean, scientific thinking on changing: 'To function effectively and help protect our heart and blood vessels, our bodies need fats - particularly unsaturated ones in olive oil, nuts and oily fish. The key is to eat natural, unprocessed fats with a focus on healthy unsaturated' ones.' There's also evidence fat can help you feel full. 

* Won't wine increase my risk of breast cancer? 
There is evidence that alcohol increases the risk of breast cancer but, if you drink in moderation, that increase is minimal. A small glass of wine (just over a unit) a puts you at 7-11% greater risk. The Government's advice is to drink no more than 2-3 units a day (the equivalent of a 175ml glass of wine) or 14 a week. However, nobody is suggesting you take up wine drinking just because Greeks and Italians do it.Red and purple grape juices also contain resveratrol, as do blueberries, cranberries and peanuts.
