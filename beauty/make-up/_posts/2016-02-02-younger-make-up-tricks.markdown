Create a more youthful and vibrant version of you with the right products cleverly applied

## BACK TO BASICS ## 

### Trick of the light ### 
Celebs have their favourite photographers 'light them' shoots - the next best thing to a cosmetic surgeon. But thanks to dazzling advances in technology, now make-up can add a fabulous luminosity to your skin. 
A shining example is [YSL Le Teint Touche Éclat Le Teint Foundation], £32.50, -- which combines the famous Touche Eclat light particles with its latest foundation for beautiful, delicate coverage. 

### A Better base ###
The right application is as important as the right according to make-up artist Carol Brown: ‘Apply the product sparingly, and only where you need. If you apply too much, even a good foundation can flood into lines and overload skin, which will make a 20-something look older,' she says. 

### Add a subtle glow ### 
Highlighters and illuminators will help give skin a youthful radiance. For a quick fix, freshen up your foundation by mixing it with your daily SPF moisturiser to create a tinted moisturiser with a protective sheen. Or try [Nivea Visage Daily Essentials Q10 Plus Anti-Wrinkle Tinted Day Cream SPF15], £10.99 - it evens out skin tone, hydrates and brightens skin. 
- On bare skin, [L'Oreal Lumi Magique Touch of Light Highlighter Pen], £8.49, is a great instant illuminator to lighten dark circles and hide imperfections. 

## VANISHING ACTS ##
Look out for specialist products designed  to disguise signs of ageing: 

### For lines ###
- [Clarins Instant Smooth Line Correcting Concentrate], £26.50, 
- [Lancôme Effet Miracle Primer], £26, all give a smoother texture and temporarily fill in lines. 

### For open pores ###
- Pat on [Benefit POREfessional Primer], £24.50, or 
- [Clinique Pore Refining Solutions Instant Perfector], £21, to create a flawless skin surface. 

### For age spots ### 
- Try [MAC Studio Finish SPF35 Concealer], £16, which makes  light work of covering dark spots and is water resistant, too. 

## GIVE EYES A LIFT ## 

### Hide away ### 
Concealer can take years off the eye area, says Kay Montano, make-up artist. She suggests applying it in a half-circle - starting at the inner corner of the eye under the brow line and following the inner eye close to the nose, then over the tear duct and a short way under the eye. Pat in, then draw a tick shape with concealer at the outer corner of the eye and pat that in. Try [Clinique Airbrush Concealer], f19. 
[Lisa Eldridge], the celebrity make-up artist, has a very good tutorial of how to use concealers effectively and many other videos.

### Optical illusion ###
Pearlised ivory or cream shadow along the brow bone will give an instant lift to eyes. Keep shimmer away from the socket, where skin tends to be more crepey. 

## PRETTY CHEEKS ##
Apply soft coral or a warm bronzing powder across cheeks - it gives a youthful, just-been-on-holiday effect. Try [Shiseido Face Color Enhancing Trio], £32.50, or [Chanel Les Beiges Healthy Glow Sheer Powder SPF15], £39.  

## FULLER LIPS ##
We subconsciously gauge a person's age by the plumpness of their lips. 
Try these tricks to make lips appear fuller: 
-   Moisturising lipsticks with a sheen give a modern edge and make lips look in better condition. 
-   Don't just line the edges of your lips with lip liner-fill in the entire lip area. This will prevent a dated-looking dark lip line and stop lipstick from feathering. Or try [Guerlain KissKiss Liplift], £25, a lip primer that you apply on and around your lips to stop lipstick bleeding. 
-	Apply lipstick to the middle of your lips, then blend it outwards with your fingers for a softer, plumper-looking finish. A nude-coloured balm that still lets the warmth of your own lip colour show through gives a modern, plumping look. Try [Fresh Sugar Honey Tinted Lip Treatment SPF15], £19. 

### Bold red lips for every age ###
'Regardless of your age or skin tone, a clean face and red lips are a modernising look’, says Carol. ‘ A touch of light-reflecting concealer to brighten the mouth area and blur lines, partnered with a lively red lip colour is instant fabulousness’. And reds can be easily personalised to make a loud, bold statement or a softer whisper of colour. 
Try [Mac Lipstick in Ruby Woo], £15.50, a cult red with a blue undertone. If sophisticated pinks and berries are your thing, Carol recommends [Armani range of lipsticks], from £25. 

### Bold colour ###
Apply straight from the bullet (it will soon mould to the shape of your lips) then soften the edge using your finger or a lip brush. That way, you get a very intense colour in the middle and a softer edge that mimics the way lips naturally fade in colour at the outer edge. 

### Subtle stain ### 
Apply lipstick, leave for a few minutes to allow the pigment to take, then blot to create a long-lasting stain. Economical, too, because it means you can dust down barely used bright red and pink lipsticks you weren’t brave enough to wear.  
 
## YOUTHFUL HANDS ##  

### Giveaway signs ### 
Dry, flaky hands and nails can add on years. Set aside some time to give yourself a DIY luxury mani with a hand mask and moisturiser for an instant de-ageing treat, says celebrity nail technician Liza Smith. Apply [Solar Oil], £11.95 to the nails, too. 

### Be clever with colour ###
A new nail colour is the quickest way to update your style. A ravishing red: Choose a warm and flattering orange-based red like [Max Factor Gel Shine Lacquer in Patent Poppy], f7.99 - bluey reds can draw attention to veins and cold skin tone. 
An on-trend blue: Go for a contemporary, easy-to-wear shade, such as [Dior Vernis in Junon], £19.50. 
A new neutral: A UV-filter and resin complex for long wear and chip-resistance, [Nails Inc NailKale Nail Polish in Montpelier Walk], £14.99, is a take-you -anywhere neutral polish for all skin tones.
