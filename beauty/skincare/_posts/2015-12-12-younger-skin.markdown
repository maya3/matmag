There are ways to improve your skin. Holistic approach to the health makes your skin younger. Among the things you can do, you have to consider impact of diet, stress, exercise on your skin.

## Your N1 – Skin saviour ##
Experts are confirming what we have always suspected. The way you feel on the inside affects the way you look on the outside. 

Dr Tom Mammone, Clinique’s executive director of skin physiology and pharmacology explains: ‘Stress unleashes chemicals that make your skin think it’s under attack’, he says. ‘Since there aren’t any real attackers, skin gets confused and starts to attack itself, and healthy cells get damaged’. This self-destruction disturbs the skin’s barrier function, making it even more damage prone. Chronic stress also stimulates adrenal glands to overproduce cortisol, a hormone that can trigger acne and eczema flare-ups. ‘Cortison decreases the skin’s ability to renew itself, leading to wrinkles and sagging’, adds psycho-dermatology expert Dr Linda Papadopoulos.

[Learning to relax][Stress less], healthy eating and exercise aren’t just good for overall wellbeing, they’re also crucial for helping your complexion look younger for longer. So much so that incorporating some stress-management strategies into your beauty routine could be one of the best things you can do for your skin.

## Radiance Ritual ##
A regular relaxing facial massage can have near yoga-like results on both complexion and mood. Using pressure-point techniques on the face can have a dramatic effect – lifting the area, promoting circulation and helping to brighten the skin, says Geraldine Howard of Aromatherapy Associates. 

-	Use your index and middle fingers to apply a row of firm pressure under your cheekbones. Start from your nose and work outwards until you reach the edge of your face. Use a rose-based facial oil to benefit circulation, and repeat twice a day. Try [Aromatherapy Associates Revitalising Face Oil], £45 or [Illa Face Oil for Glowing Radiance], £75.

-	‘The jaw holds tension and stress, too. Clench your jaw, then use index fingers to massage facial oil in small circles around the edges of your jaw’, says Geraldine.

## Boost Skin from within ##
Cosmetic surgeon now unanimously agree that yo-yo dieting hastens volume loss from the mid-face – an area already stressed by natural ageing. According to US-based science writer Thea Singer, author of [Stress less], punitive dieting also shortens telomeres (the biological sheaths that protect DNA), making skin more wrinkle prone.

Guilt-free, skin-friendly diet include

-	Pistachios (help lower blood pressure and protect DNA)
-	Oily fish such as salmon, mackerel, herring (omega 3-rich oily fish)
-	Dark berries such as blueberries, blackberries (anti-inflammatory) and pomegranate (known to combat chronic stress and boost a low mood)
-	 Plenty of water
-	Multivitamin and mineral supplement that includes calcium, which helps skin retian moisture, and vitamin D3, the ‘sunshine’ vitamin that is now known to help combat depression as well as brittle bones. ‘If your vitamin D3 is low, so is your mood. It takes six months to build up your level again’, urges cosmetic surgeon Ravjiv Grover.

## Soothe and improve ##
If you are prone to breakouts, don’t squeeze a spot. ‘It forces sebum inwards, rupturing pore walls already weakened by loss of collagen, and causing further inflammation’, warns Tom Mammone. Likewise, avoid remedies that zap sports short term but may weaken skin. Instead, choose gentle, non-drying skincare products or those specifically designed for mature skin that breaks out.

## Why damage limitation is key… ##
Lifestyle factors most likely to trigger ageing spurts are the Big Five (bereavement, job changes, house moves, marriage and divorce), often due to the rapid weight loss they cause. ‘Fat is lost from apples of the cheeks first, resulting in a drawn appearance’, says Rajiv Grover. After a nine-year study of women aged 40 to 45 in the UK, Grover discovered a stressful episode can age skin by up to 35% - seven to eight years – in just 12 months. So take steps to limit the damage.

## Hydrate and revive ##
Dry skin develops wrinkles twice as fast as well-hyrated skin. For an instant moisture boost, try 
- [Clinique’s Moisture Surge Overnight Mask], £30, which plumps and smooths fine lines. Or, if you’re on the go, a refreshing spritz of [Jurlique’s Rosewater Balancing Mist], £24 is the perfect skin-reviver and won’t smudge make-up.

## Relax and rejuvenate ##
Raducing facial stress and tension is an instant beautifier and quickly helps your face look younger, according to British hypnotherapist and Neurolinquistic Programming (NLP) expert Fiona Cook. She has devised deeply relaxing ‘audio facials’ suffused with positive suggestions. There are two 20-minute stress-reducing programmes Radiant Skin Boost and Relaxing Face Rejuvenation, which target areas where tension is held, such as jawline, eyes and forehead.
