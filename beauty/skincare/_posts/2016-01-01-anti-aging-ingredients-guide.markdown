CAN THE SIGNS OF AGEING BE REVERSED? The idea that wrinkles, pigmentation or sagging can't be reversed once they have appeared is a popular one. Ageing is a fact of life, but looking your age is not. Using various anti-ageing ingredients such as alpha-hydroxy acids (AHAs), peptides, antioxidants and anti-inflammatories will help smoothe and soften the skin while boosting collagen production. 
 
## Peptides ## 
These are naturally-occurring amino acids - the building blocks for collagen. Levels of collagen start to decline at a rate of 1% from the age of 20 onwards, leaving the skin looking less youthful. There is some evidence to suggest that peptides have the ability to stimulate collagen synthesis and activate metabolism in the skin's dermal layer. Peptides are essential in any good serum (link to serums). Bear in mind, it takes a few weeks for the effects to show, so you have to persevere.

Special peptides to look for:
-	Matrixyl 3000 Plus is used in so popular **[N 7 Protect & Perfect Intense Advanced Serum]** (£24.95, boots.com) that caused a stampede iwhen it is original version was launched in 2007 after an independent scientific proof that it actually worked.
-	Matrixyl synthe’6 has been proved to strengthen the skin, protect against wringles and improve firmness.

## Collagen ##
Collagen helps keep the skin looking firm and plump. As levels in the skin naturally decline with age, this ingredient is a popular inclusion in anti-ageing skin care. There is very little evidence that applying collagen to the skin will fight the signs of ageing. Collagen is a very large molecule and unlikely to penetrate the skin. 

## Hyaluronic acid ## 
Creams that contain hyaluronic acid are effective at temporarily plumping the skin and reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. This acid occurs naturally in the skin and is an effective moisturiser. One molecule of hyaluronic acid is said to hold up to 1,000 times its own weight in water. Serums with hyaluronic acid help to enhance the benefits of a daily moisturiser. Try **[Skinceuticals Hydrating B5 gel]**(link to serums)

## Retinol ## 
A multi-tasker, this ingredient can improve pigmentation and fine lines and boost collagen production in the skin. Retinol should not be used at the same time as any other product. Retinol can cause irritation of the skin so it may be sensible to gradually build up its use. It should be avoided during pregnancy and breastfeeding. 

## Alpha-hydroxy acids ## 
Usually found in exfoliators, these are said to remove dead skin cells in the top layers of the skin. This immediately brightens the complexion and, over time, may help improve pigmentation and fine lines. They will make skin more sensitive to sunlight, so it is important to use an SPF. 

## Antioxidants ## 
Common antioxidants include vitamin C, niacinamidem vitamin E and ubiquinone. Antioxidants reduce the impact of damage caused by free radicals and inhibit inflammation that can lead to depletion of collagen. They can also protect against UV damage.
