1. CUT POLLUTION DAMAGE 

New studies are confirming that pollution not only increases the ageing effects of UV on our skin, but causes considerable damage of its own. In particular, soot and traffic pollution cause dark spots and, experts think, play a large in the development of nose-to-lip lines. 

Recent Estée Lauder research simulated ozone levels in urban environments to measure the impact on skin cells specifically in the eye area and found that after just 20 minutes of exposure, cellular damage had by 272%. 

Cutting-edge anti-pollution technology is one of the major players in the brand's new **[Advanced Night Repair Eye Serum]** and **[Rich Gel Crème]**, £40 and £46 respectively. 

Also fighting the effects of pollution is **Lancôme's** fabulous new **[City Miracle CC Cream SPF50]**, £23.20 - £29 – a lightweight make-up meets skin – brightener hybrid, which prevents metallic pollutants sticking to skin. 

2. THE HEADLINE GRABBER 
	
When a study from the University of Reading confirmed that the peptide Matrixyl doubles collagen production in our skin cells, it had us scanning product labels (science bit: collagen production slows with age and also sustains cumulative damage, thanks to UV and inflammation - boost your collagen levels and you should look more youthful). 

Happily, Matrixyl is an ingredient found in a number of best-selling creams, including **[No7 Protect & Perfect Advanced Serum]**, £30.95 and **[Regenerist Daily 3-Point Treatment Cream]**, £31.49. 

3. SKIN TONE-SPECIFIC AGE-SPOT TARGETTING 

Old thinking about hyperpigmentation (age spots and: pigmentation) was to focus on the activity of melanocytes — the melanin-producing cells that give the skin its colour. But research at Lancôme has revealed that fibroblasts (connective tissue cells) and 500 genes control the melanocytes, so new skin ways to target skin discoloration have opened up. 

In other research, Lancôme’e scientists mapped the skin colour of 1,500 women in 10 countries to identify their specific issues. As well as fighting dark spots (a 67% reduction after two months - which is more than many products), **[Lancôme DreamTone]**, £69, comes in three versions –for fair, medium and dark skin - to address the different needs of each. So, the product for fair skin contains micro algae, which work on toning down redness and - of course - fading dark spots. The medium skin version contains maitake mushroom to reduce sallowness, while the dark skin product contains salicylic acid to fade the dark blemishes that skin type is prone to. The texture is gorgeous and it gives an instant glow, as well as moisturising.

4. CELLULAR COMMUNICATION UNLOCKED 

Meanwhile, at YSL, the big news is in deeper understanding of glycans, molecules in the skin that act like communication pathways of cells. Their research has identified different glycan receptors in particular skin cells, leading to the development of radiance-boosting, **[YSL dark-spot lightening Forever Light Creator Serum]**, £65, shown by an independent clinical trial at the University of Bradford to reduce pigmentation. 

Innovative technology in **[Clinique's Smart Custom Serum]**, £48, responds to skin distress signals, releasing appropriate ingredients as needed to target specific issues. Powerful and also allergy tested - Clinique tests each product 12 times on 600 people, and if one of those 7200 applications sees a reaction, they start again on the formulation. 

5. MOTHER KNEW BEST 

Chances are your mother told you not to go to bed without removing your make-up, and most experts now agree that thorough cleansing is the cornerstone of your skincare routine. Using a cleansing gadget such as the **[Clarisonic]**, from £125 (think giant electric toothbrush), has been shown to cleanse six times better than doing it manually. But now it's the extra exfoliation you get with a gadget that's in the spotlight. 

Exfoliating delivers anti-ageing benefits in itself; it also makes skin more receptive to anti-ageing serums and creams. Sensitive skins often struggle with cleansing brushes as they can be too abrasive, but the 35,000 bristles on **[Clinique's Sonic System Purifying Cleansing Brush]**, £79, are slightly rounded so cause less irritation. Each bristle also contains an anti-microbial silver thread that helps to keep it clean. 

6. IT’S NOT CALLED BEAUTY SLEEP FOR NOTHING 

A major US study, commissioned by Estée Lauder, revealed that poor sleepers had more signs of skin ageing than those who reported good-quality sleep. As well as more lines, pigmentation and sagging, their recovery from sunburn was slower and natural skin water loss higher, suggesting less efficient repair mechanisms. Now sleep on this...  Intelligent textiles are the next big thing in anti-ageing. **[Illuminage’s Skin Rejuvenating Pillowcase with Copper Oxide]**, £50 releases copper ions, which trials have shown can reduce lines in four weeks. It works even after it's washed as the copper oxide is fused at a cellular level. 

7. LET'S HEAR IT FOR YOUNGER-LOOKING HAIR DAYS 

Greys aren't the only sign of ageing hair. According to Dr Steve Shiel, a scientist at Procter & Gamble, there are six more: breakage, dryness, split ends, lacklustre colour, damage and thinning. And it's in the area of thinning, especially, that there are some interesting developments. For example, a small-scale trial at Yonsei University in South Korea saw 13 men and women have their scalps injected with human growth factors from their own blood plasma. The preliminary results showed that two treatments three months apart significantly boosted their hair thickness. 

Closer to home, Viviscal - the hairdresser, supermodel and GH-beauty-team favourite - has also been put through its paces in a clinical trial. The supplement contains zinc, biotin and a marine complex, designed after its creator linked the thick, healthy hair of the Greenland Inuit to their fish-protein-rich diet. The six-month trial reported a 7.4% increase in hair thickness and an 18.3% reduction in hair shedding. £49.95 for one month's supply, viviscal.co.uk. We also had great feedback from our panel of testers on **[Pantene's new Pro-V Breakage range]**, from £3.99, which contains a copper-grabbing molecule to help preserve the hair's strength-giving proteins (Pantene scientists have identified that copper absorbed from our water during the washing process can weaken the hair's protein structure over time, which ultimately appears as damage, especially breakage, making hair look older). We also rate Dove's Intensive Repair products, which fortify hair against damage with keratin repair actives that rebind damaged proteins. The Intensive Repair Self Warming Mask, £3.49, is a must.
