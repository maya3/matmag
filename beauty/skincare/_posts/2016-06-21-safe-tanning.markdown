Ultraviolet radiation is responsible for external ageing and the development of fine lines, wrinkles, pigmentation and uneven skin tone. There are two types of UV rays – UVA and UVB. UVB causes sunburn and skin cancer. UVA ones are the most damaging as their damage is below the skin surface and they penetrate through clouds and windows. It is take the advice from experts. Lesley Thomas, a beauty editor of The Times, regularly features her favourites.

Here, are the ones she recommends to wear every day for daily protection.

### For daily protection ###
 
- Dermatologists’ favourite range, SkinCeuticals, has a newish [Ultra Facial Defense SPF50] that is being raved about. The other great product is [SkinCeuticals Brightening UV Defense SPF30], £39, which will help to fade existing sun-damage marks as well as prevent them from happening again.

- [Channel’s UV Essential Multi-Protection Daily Defender], £42 is incredible light for a factor 50 fluid, and works well as a make-up base. 

- For oily skin, try [Radical Skincare Skin Perfecting Screen SPF30], £38 which will make the shiny zones matt.

- Laura Mercier’s near legendary primer lotion now comes with embedded sun protecton. [Laura Mercier The Foundation Primer Protect SPF30 UVB/UVA], £29 is just as effective as the original product, blurring lines and blemishes so much that you might not need make-up at all.

- For sensitive skins she recommends the French brand [Bioderma’s Hydrabio Eau de Soin SPF30 Moisturising Anti-UV Mist], £9. You can even spritz this over your make-up.

- To protect your lips go for [Lanolips Tinted Balm SPF30], £8.16. It nourishes lips, add a pop of colour and protects with a lanolin goodness.   

Lesley Thomas from The Sunday Times asked for advice Dr Askari Townshend, one of London's leading aesthetic doctors, for advice on sun protection on holidays.


### Prepare ahead of your holidays ###

- It is worth thinking about preparing your skin a few days or even a week before your holiday, he said. "I'd advise staying away from any powerful products for a week in advance. That means any retinols — if you're not sure, check the ingredients for vitamin A or anything with the 'refin' prefix. Don't use any strong resurfacing products such as those containing AHAs or BHAs. Your skin is going to take a beating — not just from the sun but from chlorine, sea, wind and probably the dehydrating effects of alcohol — so leave it be for at least a few days before' I'm never sure whether to exfoliate before a holiday, so that my tan isn't patchy. It's a no from Townshend. "It's not the same as a fake tan, where you are trying to make sure the product is absorbed evenly so you exfoliate the dead skin. 

- Skin supplement [Imedeen Tan Optimizer tablets], £40 with a high dose of carotenoids and vitamins C and E will help to prepare skin for sun exposure. Take them for four weeks before and then during any sun bathing. It is reported they work even on pale skins which do not sun tan easily.

### Apply sunscreen at high factor and liberally ### 

- "Many people don't use nearly enough or apply as often   as they should!' says Townshend. He says you need at least a teaspoon for your face, rather than the pea-sized dollop most of us apply. And you need to re-apply at least five times during the day - more if you are swimming or sweating a lot. And you should wear a high factor. "I should also point out that SPF20 is not high factor!' he says. "That's what you should be wearing in the UK in autumn, not on the Med in high summer. You should be wearing a 30 minimum, but 50 ideally." Townshend is a fan of Skinceuticals - I can highly recommend the [Sheer Mineral UV Defense] £30; which is hard-working but great for sensitive skins and not greasy. And, yes, you will still get a tan wearing factor 50. "You have to think of it as more of a slow roast than a high heat sizzle."
