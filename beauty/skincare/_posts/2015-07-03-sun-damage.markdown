This is a known fact that sun exposure leads to premature aging of the skin. Is is possible to measure the damage? In the study, reported  in the medical journal Clinical, Cosmetic And Investigational Dermatology, researchers wanted to calculate for the first time the effect of sunlight alone.
Dermatologists examined the faces of 298 women, aged 30 to 78, with 12 experts studying photographs of individual faces on a screen. The results show that the effect of UV exposure increases with age. Significant differences  were seen in wrinkles and skin-texture quality after  the age of 50, with the  sun-seekers looking older than their real age.

The researchers worked out what they call a ‘sun damage percentage’ and calculated that the sun is responsible for 80.3 per cent of skin ageing.
They also found that  women with 80 per cent damage look their age, while those who have 82 per cent damage look about three years older, and those with  78 per cent damage appear three years younger.

## Sun damage and collagen ##
Collagen is the scaffold of the skin. It holds all the living cells together and gives your skin its firmness, vitality and youthfulness. Unfortunately, levels of this protein in the skin start to decline from age 20. As the collagen begins to fragment, the skin loses its elasticity and fine lines begin to appear.

In addition to this natural decline, external factors can add to the effects of ageing, and the sun damage is the main culprit. Ultraviolet radiation is responsible for external ageing and the development of fine lines wrinkles, pigmentation and uneven skin tone.

A combination of products will help to address these problems. Layering products is vital to get the most benefits from skin care. Dr Anjali Mahto, Consultant Dermatologist and British Skin Foundation Spokesperson recommends a serum followed by a moisturiser and finally an SPF each morning. For evenings, she advises to try a pea-sized amount of retinol after cleansing.

### Can sunscreen help prevent signs of ageing in the skin? 
Using adequate protection from the sun is perhaps the next most popular tip for preventing wrinkles and other signs of ageing. But while this one holds a little more weight than the holy grail of water, it’s not quite as simple as slapping on some SPF.

Dr Murad, Board Certified Dermatologist and Founder of Murad Skincare, says: "The most damaging rays from the sun are in the UVA spectrum." So when looking for sun-protecting products, remember to look for a PA rating, as well as an SPF for broad spectrum protection. Also, it is important to wear it every day. "UVA rays are actually the same strength all year round and can even penetrate through clouds and windows. They can contribute to premature ageing, collagen degradation and even skin cancer," Murad adds. To give the very best protection, and anti-ageing benefits, invest in a specific SPF product in addition to any cosmetics with added protection. Murad says: "While SPF in make-up will work, it's not necessarily practical. Plus make-up can easily rub off." He suggests to think of this as an extra layer of protection, rather than their only defence. 

In a nutshell, 
## the anti-aging strategy addressing sun damage ##:
* Buying sun-protecting products, look for a PA rating, as well as an SPF for broad spectrum protection and 
* Wear it every day.
* Ideally invest in a specific SPF product in addition to any cosmetics with it. Use it as an extra layer of protection, rather than relying on a mark-up or moisturisers with it.
