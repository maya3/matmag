Don’t need to wait for a spa weekend to give yourself a top-to-toe overhaul.
Use some o these hard-working products, treatments and techniques

### Think gorgeous ###
Let your inner beauty shine through – a positive attitude is always irresistible
-	Confidence comes from how you think about yourself. If you think positive, you will appear positive.
-	Resist the urge to compare yourself unfavourably with others – they probably have body issues and confidence wobbles too
-	Try something new. Whether it’s a hair colour, fitness routine or even finally getting to grips with fake tan, setting yourself a new challenge – and achieving it – is empowering

### Buff away the years ###
Exfoliation really is the secret of beauty universe when it comes to smooth, soft, luminous skin
Normal skin cells renew every 28 days, but this process slows down with age, leaving skin looking dull and lifeless. 
Regular exfoliation gives a polished finish and increases circulation. Use a loofah or body mitt to massage damp skin, working over your body in small, circular motions. Pay attention to areas that are prone to dryness, such as your knees, elbows and feet. Or try a body polisher such as [The Sanctuary Salt Scrub], £12. made with Dead Sea salts and nourishing jojoba oil. 

Alternatively, add a handful of course brown sugar to shower gel, says cosmetic dermatologist Dr Sam Bunting.

### Tackling cellulite ### 
There is no magic bullet when it comes to cellulite, but cutting back on sugar and adopting these health and beauty habits can help a little.
-	Exercises that firm, tone and help boost circulation, such running, swimming or dancing will also help improve the appearance of cellulite. 

Most experts agree that you can rev up the circulation and tackle fluid retention (which makes cellulite look worse) by daily body brushing and self-massage. With a natural brush, such as [Aromatherapy Associates Polishing Body Brush], £15, or [The Body Shop's polishing brush], £8, for a cheaper alternative. Make long, upward-sweeping strokes towards the heart, starting at the feet, for a minute a day, before massaging in [Clarins Anti-Eau Oil], £40. 

Extracts from broom, marjoram, lemon and geranium help to boost circulation and act as diuretic, reducing fluid retention, which helps stimulate the lymphatic system, releasing toxins. Other anti-cellulite products that received favourable reviews include [Clarins Body Lift Cellulite Control], £36.

### Fast fixes for legs and feet ### 
Tired or pasty legs? Treat them to a makeover 
Try [This Works Perfect Legs Skin Miracle], £37, a tinted, blemish perfecting serum, which contains arnica to speed up bruise healing. To lengthen the look of legs and add gorgeous gleam, celebrity beauty therapist Nichola Joss suggests [St Tropez Violet Illuiminator], £12.26, on shin bones. Developed by beauty journalist Shapland, [Legology Air-Lite Daily Lift For Legs], £60 is a new-generation contouring and smoothing cream that promises lighten legs, reduce puffiness, dissolve aches, pains and fatigue energising and hydrating. 

### DIY hair removal ###  
* Make de-fuzzing easy and pain-free 
- [Gillette Venus ProSkin MoistureRich razor], £10.99, has an in-built gel strip with moisturising oils and gives a light lather, meaning you're left with super-soft legs without the need for shaving foam. 

* Home waxing system, 
- [Veet EasyWax Electrical Roll-on Kit], £31.49, heats up in 20 minutes to the perfect temperature. Then you simply roll on the wax, press on the fabric strip and remove the hair right from the roots. 
- Designed to be used wet or dry, the [Braun Silk-epil 7 Wet & Dry Dual Epilator], £150 or, 1/2 a price for a cheaper model on sale, is brilliant for long-lasting smoothness. Use every day at first to familiarise yourself with it and keep on top of hairs at different stages of their growth cycle. 

### Top skin smoothers ### 
Get the habit of applying body moisturiser regularly. It only takes a couple of minutes a day but makes a big difference 

- For daily hydration and a beautiful, uplifting fragrance: [Aveda Stress-Fix Body Creme], £27. 
- Overnight results for neglected skin: [E45 Nourish and Restore Body Lotion], £4.89. 

### Get glowing ### 
- For a natural-looking fake tan that isn’t patchy or streaky, wax or shave and exfoliate 24 hours before you tan and don't use body moisturiser on the day, advises tanning expert James Harknett. 

- Give latex gloves a miss, as they can encourage streakiness. 

- Apply a little moisturiser on bony areas like knees, wrists and ankles to stop the fake tan clinging there and looking unrealistically dark. 

### A tan for everyone ###
For staying power: 

- [L'Oreal Paris Sublime Bronze 2-week Tan], £13.49. Pigments encapsulated in a lightweight serum, lock in colour for up to two weeks. 
- Do-it-all: [Madame La La], £30. Contains anti-ageing, skin-calming and hydrating ingredients. 
- Authentic instant colour: [St Tropez Self Tan Luxe Dry Oil], £25. Fast drying, non-sticky and scented. 
- Bespoke tan: [Clarins Radiance-Plus Golden Glow Booster], £19. Mix three drops of this self-tan with your face cream. 
- Quick results: [Vita Liberata Phenomenal Tan Lotion], £37.50. It comes in three shades: fair, medium and dark. Moisturising ingredients plump up skin and prevent dry patches.
